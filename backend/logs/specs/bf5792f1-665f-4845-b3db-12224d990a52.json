The chairman of the subcommittee is indebted to  the \nmany individuals who contributed to this  document. \nElectromagnetic  flowmeters  were first introduced to the  process  industries in the mid-1950’s. \nThey  quickly became an accepted flowmeter for difficult applications. Subsequent improve- \nments in technology  and  reductions \nin cost have transformed  this  flowmeter \ninto one of the \nleading contenders for general use in water based  and  other  electrically \nconducting liquid \napplications. \nDue to differences in design of the various  electromagnetic  flowmeters in the  marketplace, \nthis Standard  cannot  address  detailed  performance  limitations \nin specific applications. It does, \nhowever, cover  issues that are  common to all meters,  including  application  considerations. \nSuggestions for improvements to this  Standard  are encouraged.

It specifically does not apply to insertion \nor medical type  electromagnetic  flowmeters. It also does \nnot cover  applications of industrial flowmeters involving \nnonconductive  liquids or highly  conductive  liquids (i.e., \nliquid metals). \nThis  document  contains a  discussion of the theory and \nmeasurement  technique of an electromagnetic flowmeter, \na  physical  description of the  various  types  available,  ap- \nplication  considerations,  specifications as to what equip- \nment markings  should  reside \non the meter, and liquid \ncalibration  procedures. \n2 REFERENCES \nUnless  otherwise  indicated,  the  latest  issue of the  fol- \nlowing  American  National  Standards \nshall be used. \nASME  B16 \nSeries,  Standards \nfor Valves, Fittings, \nFlanges,  and  Gaskets \nASME  MFC-IM, \nGlossary of Terms Used in the \nMeasurement of Fluid Flow in Pipes \nASME  MFC-2M, Measurement  Uncertainty for Fluid \nFlow in Closed Conduits \nASME  MFC-9M,  Measurement \nof Liquid Flow in \nClosed  Conduits by Weighing  Method \nASME MFC-IOM, Method for  Establishing  Installa- \ntion Effects on Flowmeters \nAWWA C207, Steel  Pipe  Flanges for Waterworks Ser- \nvice (Sizes 4 in. through 144 in.) \nSee Appendix D for other applicable  standards. \n3 TERMINOLOGY \nDefinitions  stated in ASME  MFC-IM and  MFC-2M \napply to this Standard.  Those definitions  particularly per- \ntinent to this document  are listed below, in  most cases \nin an expanded  form. \naccuracy (also referred to  as Measurement  Uncertainty, \nsee ASME  MFC-2M) - the  accuracy of a flowmeter, \nexpressed  as  a  percentage,  gives  the  maximum  expected \nplus or minus  deviation between the meter’s indication \nand  the  estimated \ntrue value of the  flow  rate. \nIt is the \ninterval within which  the  true value of a  measured  quan- \ntity can  be  expected \nto lie with  a  specified  confidence \nlevel. It is a  combination of random and systematic un- \ncertainties.  Refer to  ASME  MFC-2M  for the  procedures \nfor calculating and combining random and systematic \nuncertainties. \nbias (also referred to as  Systematic \nUncertainty,  see \nASME  MFC-2M) - the uncertainty  associated \nwith \nsystematic errors (i.e., those that cannot  be  reduced \nby \nincreasing the number of measurements taken under \nfixed flow conditions) \nlinearity - \nthe  maximum  deviation,  expressed  as  a per- \ncentage, of the  calibration \ncurve  from \na  straight \nline \npassing  through  zero  and coinciding with the  calibration \ncurve at the upper  range  value.  Linearity, \nif stated,  ap- \nplies  only  above  a  specified \nflow rate. \nprecision (also referred to as Random  Uncertainty, see \nASME  MFC-2M) - the  precision of a flowmeter, ex- \npressed as a  plus or minus  percent  deviation  about  the \nmean measured value, gives  the \ninterval within which \nrepeated  measured \nflow values taken under fixed flow \nconditions  should lie with a specified confidence level. \nIt is a  measure of the random  errors. \nprimary meter factor (also referred to as  Meter  Factor) \n- \nthe  number,  determined by liquid calibration, that en- \nables  the  output \nflow signal to be related to the volu- \nmetric flow rate under defined reference  conditions. \nrangeability (see  ASME  MFC- I M) - \nflowmeter  range- \nability is the  ratio of the  maximum \nto minimum flow \nrates in the  range over which  the  meter  meets  a specified \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

The largest value obtained over the \nfull flow range is the  meter’s  stated repeatability. \n4 THEORY AND  MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE \nThe basic  principle on which all electromagnetic flow- \nmeters are based is the Lorentz Force law (see A1 of \nAppendix A).  Consider the  electromagnetic \nflowmeter \nconfigurations  shown in Fig. 1. A  magnetic field (B) has \nbeen applied at right angles to the pipe axis in which  a \nconducting fluid is flowing. In addition,  two  electrodes \nhave been placed on opposite sides of the pipe wall \nalong a line that is at  right angles to both the pipe axis \nand  the  magnetic \nfield. The  Lorentz Force law applied \nto these  configuratlons  leads \nto an electromotive force \n(emfv) (i.e., a flow signal) being  generated  between  the \nelectrodes,  which is given by the  following: \nenfv = C . D . B,, \n* V \nwhere \nemf, = electromotive  force  (volt) \nD = flowtube  inner diameter  (meter) \nBo = magnetic field at the  center of the flowtube \nV = flow velocity (average liquid velocity over the \n(tesla) \ncross-section)  (meter/second) \nC = a dimensionless  parameter that depends on the \nspecific design of the  flowmeter  and to a lim- \nited extent on the  velocity profile. The veloc- \nity profile sensitivity of C also depends  on the \nspecific design of the  flowmeter (see  Sections \n6.2.2 and  6.4.1.1). \nIn addition to the  above  flow-related  electromotive \nforce (emf,), an electrochemical  electromotive  force \nemfc \nis also produced in the  flowtube. The magnitude \nof e&, \nwhich changes very slowly in time,  can  be com- \nparable to emf,. To reduce  the  influence of emf, on the \nflow measurement to acceptable levels, all electromag- \nnetic flowmeters  operate  with  time  varying  magnetic \nfields. The measurement electronics is designed to look \nspecifically at this  time  varying component of the  signal \ncoming  from the flowtube (for additional  details, see  A2 \nof Appendix A). \nPresent  commercial  meters \nfall into two  groups ac- \ncording to the  manner \nin which the magnetic field is \nvaried. It is termed an AC meter if the field is varied \nsinusoidally (see Fig. 2(a)), a pulsed-DC  meter \nif it is \nvaried in a  stepwise  fashion (see Figs. 2(b)  and  (c)). \nThe fact that time  varying flow related signals  are be- \ning generated  means  that, \nin principle, either wetted or \nnon-wetted (i.e., capacitive)  sensing \nelectrodes  can be \nused in the flowmeter to detect  the \nflow signal  (see \nFig. 1). \n5 FLOWMETER DESCRIPTION \n5.1 Overview \nThe electromagnetic  flowmeter \nconsists of two \nelements: \n2 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

The coils may be either AC \n6.2.2 Velocity Profile Effect \nor pulsed-DC  powered, depending on the design of the \nmeter. \nDistortions in velocity profiles may be caused by pipe \nfittings (bends, valves,  reducers, etc.) placed upstream or \ndownstream  from  the flowmeter. The resulting flow pat- \nterns may influence  the  performance \nof the  meter (see \n5.4 Outputs from \n \nthe \nSecondary \nSection 6.4. I. I). \nThe output  from  the Secondary may be'an analog  sig- \nnal (i.e., 4-20 ma DC), a pulse  output  (frequency), or a \ndigital  signal. The pulse output may be scaled or un- \nscaled. Other optional outputs include  solid-state or me- \nchanical  contact closures.  Some  designs \nalso offer  the \noption of local visual indication of rate of flow and/or \ntotalized flow. \n6 APPLICATION CONSIDERATIONS \n6.1 Process Liquid \n6.1.1 Liquid Electrical Conductivity \n6.2.3 Slippage \nThe solids in a slurry may move at a  different  velocity \nthan the liquid  (Le.,  slippage may occur). In vertical  in- \nstallations  settling  solids \nin a slurry may appear as re- \nverse flow if the  normal \nflow direction is up, and as \nforward flow if the  normal flow is down.  Depending on \nthe  application,  slippage may affect  the  relationship  be- \ntween the meter  output  and  the  quantity of interest. Con- \nsult the manufacturer  for all slurry  applications. \n6.3 Primary Device - \nSizing Considerations \nIf the  electrical  conductivity of the liquid is uniform, \nthe meter  output is generally  independent of the liquid \n6.3.1 General Considerations \nconductivity  when the latter is above  a  specified \nmini- \nmum value. The minimum liquid conductivity  should be \nobtained from the  manufacturer. \nIf, however, the conductivity is not uniform through- \nout the meter, errors may occur. Non-homogeneous \nstreams, such  as blends,  should be sufficiently mixed so \nas to have uniform electrical  conductivity \nin the mea- \nsurement  region. \nA heterogeneous  liquid,  such \nas a \nslurry, composed  of small  particles  uniformly  distributed \nin a medium  can \nbe considered an electrically  homo- \ngeneous liquid. \n6.1.2 Noisy Flow Signal \nMagnetic  flowmeters  have  high  inherent  rangeability. \nTherefore, it is normally  feasible to select  a  primary of \nthe same nominal  size as the  connecting  pipe.  When  this \nis the case, the  pressure drop through  the  Primary \ncan \nbe considered  the same as that of an;equivalent  length \nof pipe. This sizing  ability  usually  affords  a \nprocess \nfriendly installation,  particularly with regard to the mea- \nsurement of abrasive  and  fast-settling  slurry \nflows. \nIt should be noted, however, that for small  meters (1/2 \nin. and under) the  meter bore diameter is normally  based \non fluid flow rate  considerations  rather  than  pipe  size. \n6.3.2 Special Process Considerations \nExcessive  signal  noise \nmay be encountered when \nThere may be situations  where it  is desirable to size \nmeasuring some slurry flows, particularly with pulsed- \nthe flowmeter at other than the \npipe  size. \nWhen \nnmse emanates from different sources at varying fre- \nquencies and  intensities. \nThe manufacturer  should \nbe \nconsulted  for \nrecommendations when a noisy output  sig- \n6.3.2.1 Accuracy. Manufacturers  generally  spec- \nnal is observed. \nify lower \n \nabsolute \n \naccuracy \n \nas \n \nthe \n \nvelocity \n \nthrough \n \nthe \nPrimary  approaches  zero. \nIf this low velocity condition \nexists, it may be desirable to size  the  meter  at  less  than \nDC systems.

Excessive  liner  wear \nmay be  a  consideration for increasing  the  meter  size \nio \nlower the liquid velocity. However,  excessive  liner  wear \nmay be  caused  more \nby an asymmetrical flow profile \n(see Section 6.2.2), improper  liner  material  selection  (see \nSection  6.S.2), or horizontal  installation of the  Primary \n(see Section 6.4.1 .S(a)). \nIn particular,  the  leading edge (i.e., upstream edge) of \nthe  liner may be subject to wear from abrasive  slurries. \nIf this is the case, it may be beneficial to match, if pos- \nsible,  the  inside diameter of the  Primary with the inside \ndiameter of the pipe to reduce  wear of the  leading edge. \nMetal protection  rings,  which can also act  as  grounding \nrings,  can also be  installed to reduce  this  effect. \n6.3.2.4  Fast-Settling Slurries. Velocities must \nbe  high  enough to keep  slurry  solids in suspension when \nthe Primary is mounted  horizontally.  Settling may occur \nif the  Primary is sized  larger than the  pipeline.  Also, \nif \nsolids  settle \nduring no-flow conditions, there must be \nsufficient velocity to purge  the  Primary \nof sediment at \nstart-up (see Section  6.4.1 .S(b)). \n6.4 Primary Device - \nLocation, Installation, \nand  Maintenance \n6.4.1 Primary Device Location and  Orientation \nThere are no inherent  restrictions on horizontal or ver- \ntical mounting of the  device.  However, the performance \nof magnetic  flowmeters may be influenced by the loca- \ntion and orientation of the  primary  device in the piping \nsystem.  The following  points  should be considered. \n6.4.1.1 Piping Effects. Ideally, the Primary is de- \nsigned so that the  performance of the flowmeter is the \nsame regardless of flow profile. In practice, when a flow \nvelocity profile is significantly  different  from that in the \noriginal  calibration, an electromagnetic flowmeter may \nexhibit a change in performance. The arrangement  and \nlocation of pipe fittings,  valves, \npumps,  etc., \nup and \ndownstream  (especially  upstream) of the primary device, \nare  the main factors that influence  the velocity profile. \nComplete data on the  effects of flow disturbances may \nnot always be available.  Nevertheless,  manufacturers \nusually recommend  specific  upstream \nand downstream \nlengths of straight pipe of the same nominal  diameter as \nthe Primary for proper  performance. \nSwirling flow, such  as that produced by two out-of- \nplane elbows located  upstream of the Primary, may in- \ntroduce  measurement errors. When  swirling flow  is sus- \npected or known, it is advisable, if practical, to use a \nswirl  reducing \nflow conditioner. Otherwise, it may be \nnecessary to relocate  the  Primary \nwhere  swirl is not a \nfactor. \n6.4.1.2 Full Pipe Requirements. The primary \ndevice  should be mounted in such a position that it is \ncompletely filled with the liquid  being  metered.  Other- \nwise,  this  Standard  does not apply, and the  measurement \nmay not be within the  manufacturer’s  stated accuracy. It \nmay, for  example, be difficult to  assure a full pipe in a \nvertical-down flow situation. \n6.4.1.3 Electrode Position - Horizontal In- \nstallations. Since  gas bubbles in a horizontal pipe tend \nto rise and may collect at the top of the  pipe, the primary \ndevice  should  be  mounted so that no sensing or ground- \ning electrodes are located at or near  the  top of the  pipe. \n6.4.1.4  In-Situ Zero Checking. If it is desired \nto check the flowmeter zero in-situ, a method must be \nprovided to stop the flow through the primary device, \nleaving it filled with stationary  liquid. \n6.4.1.5 Entrained Solids (Slurries). There are \ntwo  major  location  and  installation  considerations  for the \nmeasurement of liquids containing entrained  solids  (i.e., \nslurries). The manufacturer  should be consulted for all \nslurry  applications. \n(a) Abrasive Slurries. Abrasive  slurries  can cause un- \neven or excessive  liner \nwear. On the  premise \nthat a \nproper choice of liner is made (see Section  6.5.2), an \nimportant  factor in reducing  liner  wear is to have suffi- \ncient  straight length of upstream  piping to ensure that a \nsymmetrical velocity profile exists within the Primary \n(see  Section 6.4.1.1).  This tends to minimize  localized \nerosion of the liner. \nIn addition, since slurry  solids  tend to move along  the \nbottom of a horizontal pipe, excessive liner wear may \noccur in the  bottom of a horizontally  mounted Primary, \nparticularly with  highly  abrasive  slurries. \nVertical \nmounting of the primary device can prevent this situation \n(see  Section  6.2.3). \n(b) Solids Settling-Our. Under flowing conditions, \npipeline  velocities  should  be \nhigh enough to avoid set- \ntling of solids  (see  Section \n6.3.2.3).  Smooth transitions \nbetween the pipe and  the  Primary  can  reduce  settling. \nWhen  the flow stops, however, solids may settle out in \nthe Primary. Vertical mounting of the flowmeter can \navoid this  problem (see Section  6.2.3). \n6.4.1.6 Location with Regard to Electrical \nInterference. Under  most field situations,  electrical in- \nterference is not a problem.  However, \nif feasible,  the \nPrimary  should be installed in an area  where  minimal \n5 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Uncontrolled w\n\nASME  MFC-16M-1995 \nelectrical  interference,  which may result  from  equipment \noperating at high  voltage \nand/or high  current, \nis \nexpected. \nWhen  this is not possible  with  remotely  mounted Sec- \nondaries, the Primary and  Secondary should  be  located \nso that the  signal cable is run in conduit, which  can be \nseparated  from  wiring that is at  high voltage and/or car- \nries  high current. \nSome installations such as  electrolytic  processes, \nwhere  high currents may  be  flowing  through  the  piping \nand  the  liquid (and, consequently,  through  the  Primary) \nhave inherently high electrical  interferences. The man- \nufacturer  should  be  contacted for specific  grounding  and \npossibly  isolation  procedure(s) in these  situations. \n6.4.2 Installation of Primary Device \n6.4.2.1 Installation Design. When  designing the \npiping system, access  for installing  and  removing  the \nprimary device, as well as access  to the electrical  con- \nnections,  should  be  provided. Care should be taken  dur- \ning pipework construction to minimize  the  strain on the \nprimary device either  during or after  installation. \n6.4.2.2  Handling of the Primary Device. Care \nshould be taken  when  handling \nthe primary  device. \nSlings around the  primary device, or lifting  lugs,  should \nbe used on large  primary devices. Lifting by any means \nthat could damage the  liner  should be avoided. \n6.4.2.3  Pipework  Alignment  and \nConnect- \nors. Allowance  should  be \nmade for the length- of the \nPrimary,  the gaskets, and  the alignment of the  Primary \nwith the connecting pipe. \n6.4.2.4 Transition Piping. When the connecting \npipe is of a  different  size than the  Primary, it is advisable \nto use concentric reducers  upstream  and  downstream \nof \nthe Primary to affect a gradual transition  from one di- \nameter to another. In most applications,  this  should \nre- \nduce pressure loss and flow disturbance effects.  Unless \nthese  reducers \nhave a relatively shallow  taper  (typical \nmanufacturers’ recommendations vary from 8 to 15 de- \ngrees  maximum  included angle), they should be installed \nat locations  that  permit  the  manufacturers’  normal \nup- \nstream  and  downstream  straight \npipe run recommenda- \ntions to be followed.  Consult  the  manufacturer  for other \ntypes of transition  piping. \n6.4.3 Electrical Installation \n6.4.3.1  General \nRequirements. The metered \nliquid,  the  primary  device \nbody, and  the  secondary \nshould  be at the same potential,  preferably earth poten- \nMEASUREMENT  OF  FLUID  FLOW  IN CLOSED CONDUITS \nBY MEANS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC  FLOWMETERS \ntial. The manufacturer’s  instructions  should be carefully \nfollowed for interconnections  between  the  primary \nand \nsecondary  device. \nThe electrical  connection between  the liquid and  the \nprimary  device  body \nmay be made by contact  with  the \nconnecting  pipework, or by conductive grounding  (earth- \ning)  rings or electrodes.  When  lined \nor nonconductive \npipework is used, the manufacturer’s recommendations \nshould  be  adhered to, since  proper  grounding  (earthing) \nis very important. \n6.4.3.2 Power Factor (AC Systems  Only). Be- \ncause the  Primary has  coils  to  provide  the magnetic field, \nit may have a low power factor. To improve  the  power \nfactor, capacitors may be connected in parallel  with  the \nsupply by arrangement  with the manufacturer. \n6.4.3.3 Cathodic Protection. When  an  electro- \nmagnetic  flowmeter  primary device is installed in a ca- \nthodic  protected  pipeline,  precautions \nmay be  necessary \nto ensure that the  DC  component of the cathodic  current \ndoes not affect the accuracy  and  stability \nof the flow- \nmeter  system. In such a case, relevant  electric codes and \nmanufacturer’s recommendations should  be  consulted. \n6.4.4 Coatings and Deposits \nIf insulating or conducting materials are  deposited \nfrom  the  process  liquid \nonto the electrodes or the walls \nof the  meter tube, the performance of the  meter may be \naffected. In such  situations,  provision  should  be \nmade \nfor cleaning the electrodes, by either electrical, chemical, \nultrasonic, or mechanical  methods. This can  be accom- \nplished with the  flowmeter connected  to the  pipework, \nor removed  from it. Manufacturers  should  be  consulted \nfor the  various options available. \n6.5 Primary Device - \nMaterials of \nConstruction \n6.5.1 General Guidelines \nMaterials  used for  construction of process  wetted  parts \nmust be compatible with the  process. \nSafety  and  environmental  programs of end users  may \nrequire complete traceability of all process wetted and \ncontainment  materials \nused in the  manufacture \nof the \nprimary. \n6.5.2 Liner Materials \nWhen selecting a liner, the  process  liquid \nand any \ncleaning agents that will be  flowing  through  the  pipeline \n6 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Some  examples and  general appli- \ncation guidelines for liner  materials are  summarized in \nAppendix C.  These materials  have  generally  good  wear \nresistance. The manufacturer  should  be  contacted for the \nspecifications  and recommendations regarding  their  liner \nmaterials. \n6.5.3 Electrode Materials \nWhen  selecting an electrode,  the  process  liquid \nand \nany  cleaning \nagents that will be flowing through the \npipeline  must  be considered.  Examples of electrode ma- \nterials  include \nStainless Steel,  Hastelloy \nC, Platinum, \nPlatinum/Iridium, Tantalum,  Titanium,  and  Zirconium. \nManufacturers  should  be  contacted  for  specifications and \nrecommendations  regarding  their  electrode  materials. \n6.6 Secondary Device - \nInstallation \n6.6.1 Location of Secondary Device \nSecondary  devices  should be installed in an accessible \nposition with due regard  being  given to the manufactur- \ner’s  specifications. \n6.6.2 Electrical Installation \nThe  cables \ncarrying  the  electrode  signals  and  coil \ndrive and/or reference  signals  should  be \nof a type  ap- \nproved by the  manufacturer. \nCare should  be  taken to  ensure that signal cables  are \nnot routed in the same  conduits or wireways as high \nvoltage and/or high  current  carrying  cables.  Signal \nca- \nbles and  coil  drive and/or reference cables can  generally \nbe run in the same  conduit or wireway, but the  manu- \nfacturers’  instructions  should  be  followed for the  specific \ntype of flowmeter  system  being  installed. \nIf the equipment must  be  mounted \nin an area of po- \ntentially  high  electrical  interference,  the  signal,  coil, a n d  \nor reference  wiring  between the Primary  and a remotely \nmounted  Secondary  should  be  run \nin a conduit which is \nphysically  separated from high voltage and/or high cur- \nrent wiring  and equipment. \n6.7 Safety \n6.7.1 Electrical Safety \nThe primary and secondary  portions of the metering \nsystem  must  be designed, manufactured, and certified to \nmeet or exceed the  electrical  classification \nfor the  area \nin  which  installed. \nASME MFC-16M-1995 \nCabling Supplied by manufacturers to  connect \npri- \nmaries  and  secondaries  must  meet \nor  exceed area  elec- \ntrical  classifications  and  user \nsafety  codes.  The  cable \nused to connect the  meter  power  source  and  to connect \nthe  meter  output  signal to  the user’s  system  should also \nmeet area  electrical  classifications. \n6.7.2 Mechanical Safety \nThe Primary,  which is an integral  portion of the piping \nsystem, must  be designed, manufactured,  and certified to \nmeet or exceed  industry standards for piping codes (i.e., \nASME B 16 Series,  etc.)  and classifications. If this is not \nfeasible in a  given application,  the user  and  manufacturer \nmust  agree on what ratings are to apply. User  require- \nments for specific location piping  codes, material  trace- \nability, primary  cleanability,  x-rays,  etc.,  need \nto be ne- \ngotiated on an individual  basis  between  manufacturer \nand user. \nWhen using reducers and  expanders in the piping  sys- \ntem, the system  and drains  should be  designed so that \ntrapping of process fluids is avoided  and complete sys- \ntem  cleaning  needs  are \naddressed. \n7 EQUIPMENT MARKINGS \n7.1 Introduction \nThe Primary  and  Secondary  should  be  marked  either \ndirectly or on a name plate attached  thereto as indicated \nbelow. \n7.2 Primary Device \n7.2.1 Mandatory Information \n(a) Instrument  type and serial number \n(6) Liner  Material \n(c) Electrode  Material \n(d) Maximum  rated process temperature \n(e) Maximum  rated \nprocess pressure  (at  maximum \nv) Voltage, frequency, and power  requirements, if in- \n( g )  Enclosure  protection  rating \n(\\I) Flow direction  indication \nrated process temperature) \ndependently  powered \n7.2.2 Optional  Information \n(a) Nominal diameter \n(b) Meter  factor \n7 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

If this is not feasible, \nthe  user  must \nrely on a laboratory liquid calibration of \nthe  magnetic flowmeter. This calibration may be in the \nuser’s own  in-house  facility, that of the manufacturer, or \nan independent or  government testing  laboratory. \n8.2 Calibration Conditions \nThe Primary  should  be calibrated under  specified ref- \nerence  conditions.  The  ambient temperature  range,  liquid \ntemperature  range,  liquid  conductivity  range,  supply \nvoltage, and the  pipeline diameter should  be  given  as the \nreference conditions. \nThe user may want to request a system  calibration in \nwhich  the  Primary \nand  Secondary are  calibrated \nas a \nunit. This may result in improved  accuracy. \n8.3 Calibration Facilities \nThe flowmeter  calibration  facilities  should \nbe either \ngravimetric or volumetric  based,  and  shall  be  traceable \nto  NIST or some  other recognized  national or interna- \ntional standard.

Assume that a uniform  magnetic field (B) is ap- \nplied at right angles to the top and  bottom of the  conduit, \nand that the velocity profile of the conducting  liquid \nflowing full in the conduit is flat (i.e., a constant  axial \nvelocity (v)) over the entire cross-section. \nIn this  situation  the  Lorentz  force  acting on any given \ncharged  particle in the flowing liquid is the same and is \ngiven by Eq. (I), as shown by the  following: \nF, = q . B . v  \n(2) \nwhere \nF, = force on particle  moving  with liquid [newton], \nv = axial  liquid velocity [meter/second]. \nThis force is at right angles  to the  sides of the  conduit. \nThe work (W) done by the  Lorentz  force, \nif it were to \nmove one of these charges from  one side of the conduit \nto the other, is the  force (F,) times  the  distance \n(s), as \nshown by the following: \nW,, = FG = q * s * B * v  \n(3) \nwhere \nW, = work done by Lorentz. force (joule) \ns = width of conduit  (meter) \nHence, the electromotive  force \n(emf, (i.e., the work \nper unit charge) that this  device is capable of generating \nis as  follows: \nemfv = s * B \nv \n(4) \nwhere \nemf, = electromotive  force (volt) \nHence, for a fixed s and a known B, a measurement \nof the emjgenerated by the Lorentz  force (emfv) yields \na  measurement of the fluid velocity. \nIn typical  industrial  flowmeters  the conduit  is circular \nin  cross-section, the magnetic field is not uniform,  and \nthe liquid velocity profile is non-uniform  and a function \nof flow rate. Nevertheless, it can be  shown  theoretically \n(see Shercliff, J.A., Appendix D) and  demonstrated ex- \nperimentally that in this  general  situation  the \nemf gen- \nerated by the Lorentz force is given by the  following: \netnfv = C * D * Bo V \n(5) \nwhere \nemf, = electromotive force (volt) \nD = flowtube inner  diameter (meter) \n9 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Since its  magnitude can be comparable \nto emfv, a measurement  technique \nthat distinguishes \nemf, from emf, must be utilized. \nThe solution to this  problem,  which  takes \nadvantage \nof the  fact that the  electrochemical \nemf changes very \nslowly  with  time, is to vary the  magnetic field in a fixed \nperiodic  manner  (i.e., \nat a fixed frequency). The  elec- \ntronics in the  secondary device  are designed to  measure \nspecifically  this  time  varying component of the emf gen- \nerated in the  primary. To obtain  a  good \nflow measure- \nment, the  period of this  variation must be shorter  than \nthe  time it takes for emf, to drift to a detectable amount. \n10 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Uncontrolled w\n\nVarying the magnetic field to eliminate the effect of \nemfc introduces  yet another  source of emf, the induced \nemf (emf,), a  phenomenon commonly referred to as the \ntransformer  effect. This emf is equal in magnitude to the \nrate of change of the  magnetic \nflux through  the  area \ndefined by the  electrical connections leading  from the \nsecondary to the electrodes in  the  primary  device. \nThe influence of varying the magnetic field on the \nflow measurement  can  be  reduced \nto acceptable  levels \nby  appropriate measurement technqiues. In  the  case of \nAC meters emf, is 90 degrees out-of-phase (i.e., in quad- \nrature) with emfv and  hence its influence can be  reduced \nby phase  sensitive  detection techniques, using the phase \nof the  magnetic field, or a  related  electrical  quantity, \nas \nthe  reference. In the case of pulsed-DC  meters, the mea- \nsurement of e l ~ f ,  \nis made during  the  time  when the  mag- \nnetic field is,  ideally, not changing, and  hence emfi ap- \nproaches  zero. \n11 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Uncontrolled w\n\n(This Foreword is not part of ASME  MFC-16M-1995.) \nThis Standard  was prepared by Subcommittee 5 of the ASME  Committee on the  Measure- \nment of Fluid Flow in Closed  Conduits. The chairman of the subcommittee is indebted to  the \nmany individuals who contributed to this  document. \nElectromagnetic  flowmeters  were first introduced to the  process  industries in the mid-1950’s. \nThey  quickly became an accepted flowmeter for difficult applications. Subsequent improve- \nments in technology  and  reductions \nin cost have transformed  this  flowmeter \ninto one of the \nleading contenders for general use in water based  and  other  electrically \nconducting liquid \napplications. \nDue to differences in design of the various  electromagnetic  flowmeters in the  marketplace, \nthis Standard  cannot  address  detailed  performance  limitations \nin specific applications. It does, \nhowever, cover  issues that are  common to all meters,  including  application  considerations. \nSuggestions for improvements to this  Standard  are encouraged. They  should  be sent to the \nSecretary, ASME  MFC Main Committee,  The American  Society of Mechanical  Engineers, 345 \nEast  47th Street, New York, N.Y. 10017. \nThis Standard was approved by the  American  National  Standards  Institute \n(ANSI) on April \n14, 1995. \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

It specifically does not apply to insertion \nor medical type  electromagnetic  flowmeters. It also does \nnot cover  applications of industrial flowmeters involving \nnonconductive  liquids or highly  conductive  liquids (i.e., \nliquid metals). \nThis  document  contains a  discussion of the theory and \nmeasurement  technique of an electromagnetic flowmeter, \na  physical  description of the  various  types  available,  ap- \nplication  considerations,  specifications as to what equip- \nment markings  should  reside \non the meter, and liquid \ncalibration  procedures. \n2 REFERENCES \nUnless  otherwise  indicated,  the  latest  issue of the  fol- \nlowing  American  National  Standards \nshall be used. \nASME  B16 \nSeries,  Standards \nfor Valves, Fittings, \nFlanges,  and  Gaskets \nASME  MFC-IM, \nGlossary of Terms Used in the \nMeasurement of Fluid Flow in Pipes \nASME  MFC-2M, Measurement  Uncertainty for Fluid \nFlow in Closed Conduits \nASME  MFC-9M,  Measurement \nof Liquid Flow in \nClosed  Conduits by Weighing  Method \nASME MFC-IOM, Method for  Establishing  Installa- \ntion Effects on Flowmeters \nAWWA C207, Steel  Pipe  Flanges for Waterworks Ser- \nvice (Sizes 4 in. through 144 in.) \nSee Appendix D for other applicable  standards. \n3 TERMINOLOGY \nDefinitions  stated in ASME  MFC-IM and  MFC-2M \napply to this Standard.

The largest value obtained over the \nfull flow range is the  meter’s  stated repeatability. \n4 THEORY AND  MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE \nThe basic  principle on which all electromagnetic flow- \nmeters are based is the Lorentz Force law (see A1 of \nAppendix A).  Consider the  electromagnetic \nflowmeter \nconfigurations  shown in Fig. 1. A  magnetic field (B) has \nbeen applied at right angles to the pipe axis in which  a \nconducting fluid is flowing. In addition,  two  electrodes \nhave been placed on opposite sides of the pipe wall \nalong a line that is at  right angles to both the pipe axis \nand  the  magnetic \nfield. The  Lorentz Force law applied \nto these  configuratlons  leads \nto an electromotive force \n(emfv) (i.e., a flow signal) being  generated  between  the \nelectrodes,  which is given by the  following: \nenfv = C . D . B,, \n* V \nwhere \nemf, = electromotive  force  (volt) \nD = flowtube  inner diameter  (meter) \nBo = magnetic field at the  center of the flowtube \nV = flow velocity (average liquid velocity over the \n(tesla) \ncross-section)  (meter/second) \nC = a dimensionless  parameter that depends on the \nspecific design of the  flowmeter  and to a lim- \nited extent on the  velocity profile. The veloc- \nity profile sensitivity of C also depends  on the \nspecific design of the  flowmeter (see  Sections \n6.2.2 and  6.4.1.1). \nIn addition to the  above  flow-related  electromotive \nforce (emf,), an electrochemical  electromotive  force \nemfc \nis also produced in the  flowtube. The magnitude \nof e&, \nwhich changes very slowly in time,  can  be com- \nparable to emf,. To reduce  the  influence of emf, on the \nflow measurement to acceptable levels, all electromag- \nnetic flowmeters  operate  with  time  varying  magnetic \nfields. The measurement electronics is designed to look \nspecifically at this  time  varying component of the  signal \ncoming  from the flowtube (for additional  details, see  A2 \nof Appendix A). \nPresent  commercial  meters \nfall into two  groups ac- \ncording to the  manner \nin which the magnetic field is \nvaried. It is termed an AC meter if the field is varied \nsinusoidally (see Fig. 2(a)), a pulsed-DC  meter \nif it is \nvaried in a  stepwise  fashion (see Figs. 2(b)  and  (c)). \nThe fact that time  varying flow related signals  are be- \ning generated  means  that, \nin principle, either wetted or \nnon-wetted (i.e., capacitive)  sensing \nelectrodes  can be \nused in the flowmeter to detect  the \nflow signal  (see \nFig. 1). \n5 FLOWMETER DESCRIPTION \n5.1 Overview \nThe electromagnetic  flowmeter \nconsists of two \nelements: \n2 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

It also includes  magnetic \nfield coils and two or \nmore  sensing  electrodes \nthat may be wetted or non- \nwetted (see Fig. 1). It may also include  grounding  elec- \ntrodes, or grounding  rings as required by the application \nor design of the meter. \n5.3 Secondary Device \nThe Secondary  consists of the  electronic  transmitter \nand  its  housing \nwhich may be mounted either integral \nwith the  Primary, \nor remotely. If the  Secondary \nis \nmounted  remotely  from the Primary, it may be necessary \nto have a  separate  electrical  connection  housing,  termin- \nals, and pre-amplifier  mounted \non the Primary, if re- \nquired by the  design of the electronics.

The coils may be either AC \n6.2.2 Velocity Profile Effect \nor pulsed-DC  powered, depending on the design of the \nmeter. \nDistortions in velocity profiles may be caused by pipe \nfittings (bends, valves,  reducers, etc.) placed upstream or \ndownstream  from  the flowmeter. The resulting flow pat- \nterns may influence  the  performance \nof the  meter (see \n5.4 Outputs from \n \nthe \nSecondary \nSection 6.4. I. I). \nThe output  from  the Secondary may be'an analog  sig- \nnal (i.e., 4-20 ma DC), a pulse  output  (frequency), or a \ndigital  signal. The pulse output may be scaled or un- \nscaled. Other optional outputs include  solid-state or me- \nchanical  contact closures.  Some  designs \nalso offer  the \noption of local visual indication of rate of flow and/or \ntotalized flow. \n6 APPLICATION CONSIDERATIONS \n6.1 Process Liquid \n6.1.1 Liquid Electrical Conductivity \n6.2.3 Slippage \nThe solids in a slurry may move at a  different  velocity \nthan the liquid  (Le.,  slippage may occur). In vertical  in- \nstallations  settling  solids \nin a slurry may appear as re- \nverse flow if the  normal \nflow direction is up, and as \nforward flow if the  normal flow is down.  Depending on \nthe  application,  slippage may affect  the  relationship  be- \ntween the meter  output  and  the  quantity of interest. Con- \nsult the manufacturer  for all slurry  applications. \n6.3 Primary Device - \nSizing Considerations \nIf the  electrical  conductivity of the liquid is uniform, \nthe meter  output is generally  independent of the liquid \n6.3.1 General Considerations \nconductivity  when the latter is above  a  specified \nmini- \nmum value. The minimum liquid conductivity  should be \nobtained from the  manufacturer. \nIf, however, the conductivity is not uniform through- \nout the meter, errors may occur. Non-homogeneous \nstreams, such  as blends,  should be sufficiently mixed so \nas to have uniform electrical  conductivity \nin the mea- \nsurement  region. \nA heterogeneous  liquid,  such \nas a \nslurry, composed  of small  particles  uniformly  distributed \nin a medium  can \nbe considered an electrically  homo- \ngeneous liquid. \n6.1.2 Noisy Flow Signal \nMagnetic  flowmeters  have  high  inherent  rangeability. \nTherefore, it is normally  feasible to select  a  primary of \nthe same nominal  size as the  connecting  pipe.  When  this \nis the case, the  pressure drop through  the  Primary \ncan \nbe considered  the same as that of an;equivalent  length \nof pipe. This sizing  ability  usually  affords  a \nprocess \nfriendly installation,  particularly with regard to the mea- \nsurement of abrasive  and  fast-settling  slurry \nflows. \nIt should be noted, however, that for small  meters (1/2 \nin. and under) the  meter bore diameter is normally  based \non fluid flow rate  considerations  rather  than  pipe  size. \n6.3.2 Special Process Considerations \nExcessive  signal  noise \nmay be encountered when \nThere may be situations  where it  is desirable to size \nmeasuring some slurry flows, particularly with pulsed- \nthe flowmeter at other than the \npipe  size. \nWhen \nnmse emanates from different sources at varying fre- \nquencies and  intensities. \nThe manufacturer  should \nbe \nconsulted  for \nrecommendations when a noisy output  sig- \n6.3.2.1 Accuracy.

Uncontrolled w\n\nMEASUREMENT OF FLUID FLOW IN CLOSED CONDUITS \nBY MEANS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC  FLOWMETERS \nASME MFC-16M-1995 \n6.3.2.3 Abrasive Slurries. Excessive  liner  wear \nmay be  a  consideration for increasing  the  meter  size \nio \nlower the liquid velocity. However,  excessive  liner  wear \nmay be  caused  more \nby an asymmetrical flow profile \n(see Section 6.2.2), improper  liner  material  selection  (see \nSection  6.S.2), or horizontal  installation of the  Primary \n(see Section 6.4.1 .S(a)). \nIn particular,  the  leading edge (i.e., upstream edge) of \nthe  liner may be subject to wear from abrasive  slurries. \nIf this is the case, it may be beneficial to match, if pos- \nsible,  the  inside diameter of the  Primary with the inside \ndiameter of the pipe to reduce  wear of the  leading edge. \nMetal protection  rings,  which can also act  as  grounding \nrings,  can also be  installed to reduce  this  effect. \n6.3.2.4  Fast-Settling Slurries. Velocities must \nbe  high  enough to keep  slurry  solids in suspension when \nthe Primary is mounted  horizontally.  Settling may occur \nif the  Primary is sized  larger than the  pipeline.  Also, \nif \nsolids  settle \nduring no-flow conditions, there must be \nsufficient velocity to purge  the  Primary \nof sediment at \nstart-up (see Section  6.4.1 .S(b)). \n6.4 Primary Device - \nLocation, Installation, \nand  Maintenance \n6.4.1 Primary Device Location and  Orientation \nThere are no inherent  restrictions on horizontal or ver- \ntical mounting of the  device.  However, the performance \nof magnetic  flowmeters may be influenced by the loca- \ntion and orientation of the  primary  device in the piping \nsystem.  The following  points  should be considered. \n6.4.1.1 Piping Effects. Ideally, the Primary is de- \nsigned so that the  performance of the flowmeter is the \nsame regardless of flow profile. In practice, when a flow \nvelocity profile is significantly  different  from that in the \noriginal  calibration, an electromagnetic flowmeter may \nexhibit a change in performance. The arrangement  and \nlocation of pipe fittings,  valves, \npumps,  etc., \nup and \ndownstream  (especially  upstream) of the primary device, \nare  the main factors that influence  the velocity profile. \nComplete data on the  effects of flow disturbances may \nnot always be available.  Nevertheless,  manufacturers \nusually recommend  specific  upstream \nand downstream \nlengths of straight pipe of the same nominal  diameter as \nthe Primary for proper  performance. \nSwirling flow, such  as that produced by two out-of- \nplane elbows located  upstream of the Primary, may in- \ntroduce  measurement errors. When  swirling flow  is sus- \npected or known, it is advisable, if practical, to use a \nswirl  reducing \nflow conditioner. Otherwise, it may be \nnecessary to relocate  the  Primary \nwhere  swirl is not a \nfactor. \n6.4.1.2 Full Pipe Requirements. The primary \ndevice  should be mounted in such a position that it is \ncompletely filled with the liquid  being  metered.  Other- \nwise,  this  Standard  does not apply, and the  measurement \nmay not be within the  manufacturer’s  stated accuracy. It \nmay, for  example, be difficult to  assure a full pipe in a \nvertical-down flow situation. \n6.4.1.3 Electrode Position - Horizontal In- \nstallations. Since  gas bubbles in a horizontal pipe tend \nto rise and may collect at the top of the  pipe, the primary \ndevice  should  be  mounted so that no sensing or ground- \ning electrodes are located at or near  the  top of the  pipe. \n6.4.1.4  In-Situ Zero Checking. If it is desired \nto check the flowmeter zero in-situ, a method must be \nprovided to stop the flow through the primary device, \nleaving it filled with stationary  liquid. \n6.4.1.5 Entrained Solids (Slurries). There are \ntwo  major  location  and  installation  considerations  for the \nmeasurement of liquids containing entrained  solids  (i.e., \nslurries). The manufacturer  should be consulted for all \nslurry  applications. \n(a) Abrasive Slurries. Abrasive  slurries  can cause un- \neven or excessive  liner \nwear. On the  premise \nthat a \nproper choice of liner is made (see Section  6.5.2), an \nimportant  factor in reducing  liner  wear is to have suffi- \ncient  straight length of upstream  piping to ensure that a \nsymmetrical velocity profile exists within the Primary \n(see  Section 6.4.1.1).  This tends to minimize  localized \nerosion of the liner. \nIn addition, since slurry  solids  tend to move along  the \nbottom of a horizontal pipe, excessive liner wear may \noccur in the  bottom of a horizontally  mounted Primary, \nparticularly with  highly  abrasive  slurries. \nVertical \nmounting of the primary device can prevent this situation \n(see  Section  6.2.3). \n(b) Solids Settling-Our. Under flowing conditions, \npipeline  velocities  should  be \nhigh enough to avoid set- \ntling of solids  (see  Section \n6.3.2.3).  Smooth transitions \nbetween the pipe and  the  Primary  can  reduce  settling. \nWhen  the flow stops, however, solids may settle out in \nthe Primary. Vertical mounting of the flowmeter can \navoid this  problem (see Section  6.2.3). \n6.4.1.6 Location with Regard to Electrical \nInterference. Under  most field situations,  electrical in- \nterference is not a problem.  However, \nif feasible,  the \nPrimary  should be installed in an area  where  minimal \n5 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Uncontrolled w\n\nASME  MFC-16M-1995 \nelectrical  interference,  which may result  from  equipment \noperating at high  voltage \nand/or high  current, \nis \nexpected. \nWhen  this is not possible  with  remotely  mounted Sec- \nondaries, the Primary and  Secondary should  be  located \nso that the  signal cable is run in conduit, which  can be \nseparated  from  wiring that is at  high voltage and/or car- \nries  high current. \nSome installations such as  electrolytic  processes, \nwhere  high currents may  be  flowing  through  the  piping \nand  the  liquid (and, consequently,  through  the  Primary) \nhave inherently high electrical  interferences. The man- \nufacturer  should  be  contacted for specific  grounding  and \npossibly  isolation  procedure(s) in these  situations. \n6.4.2 Installation of Primary Device \n6.4.2.1 Installation Design. When  designing the \npiping system, access  for installing  and  removing  the \nprimary device, as well as access  to the electrical  con- \nnections,  should  be  provided. Care should be taken  dur- \ning pipework construction to minimize  the  strain on the \nprimary device either  during or after  installation. \n6.4.2.2  Handling of the Primary Device. Care \nshould be taken  when  handling \nthe primary  device. \nSlings around the  primary device, or lifting  lugs,  should \nbe used on large  primary devices. Lifting by any means \nthat could damage the  liner  should be avoided. \n6.4.2.3  Pipework  Alignment  and \nConnect- \nors. Allowance  should  be \nmade for the length- of the \nPrimary,  the gaskets, and  the alignment of the  Primary \nwith the connecting pipe. \n6.4.2.4 Transition Piping. When the connecting \npipe is of a  different  size than the  Primary, it is advisable \nto use concentric reducers  upstream  and  downstream \nof \nthe Primary to affect a gradual transition  from one di- \nameter to another. In most applications,  this  should \nre- \nduce pressure loss and flow disturbance effects.  Unless \nthese  reducers \nhave a relatively shallow  taper  (typical \nmanufacturers’ recommendations vary from 8 to 15 de- \ngrees  maximum  included angle), they should be installed \nat locations  that  permit  the  manufacturers’  normal \nup- \nstream  and  downstream  straight \npipe run recommenda- \ntions to be followed.  Consult  the  manufacturer  for other \ntypes of transition  piping. \n6.4.3 Electrical Installation \n6.4.3.1  General \nRequirements. The metered \nliquid,  the  primary  device \nbody, and  the  secondary \nshould  be at the same potential,  preferably earth poten- \nMEASUREMENT  OF  FLUID  FLOW  IN CLOSED CONDUITS \nBY MEANS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC  FLOWMETERS \ntial. The manufacturer’s  instructions  should be carefully \nfollowed for interconnections  between  the  primary \nand \nsecondary  device. \nThe electrical  connection between  the liquid and  the \nprimary  device  body \nmay be made by contact  with  the \nconnecting  pipework, or by conductive grounding  (earth- \ning)  rings or electrodes.  When  lined \nor nonconductive \npipework is used, the manufacturer’s recommendations \nshould  be  adhered to, since  proper  grounding  (earthing) \nis very important. \n6.4.3.2 Power Factor (AC Systems  Only). Be- \ncause the  Primary has  coils  to  provide  the magnetic field, \nit may have a low power factor. To improve  the  power \nfactor, capacitors may be connected in parallel  with  the \nsupply by arrangement  with the manufacturer. \n6.4.3.3 Cathodic Protection. When  an  electro- \nmagnetic  flowmeter  primary device is installed in a ca- \nthodic  protected  pipeline,  precautions \nmay be  necessary \nto ensure that the  DC  component of the cathodic  current \ndoes not affect the accuracy  and  stability \nof the flow- \nmeter  system. In such a case, relevant  electric codes and \nmanufacturer’s recommendations should  be  consulted. \n6.4.4 Coatings and Deposits \nIf insulating or conducting materials are  deposited \nfrom  the  process  liquid \nonto the electrodes or the walls \nof the  meter tube, the performance of the  meter may be \naffected. In such  situations,  provision  should  be \nmade \nfor cleaning the electrodes, by either electrical, chemical, \nultrasonic, or mechanical  methods. This can  be accom- \nplished with the  flowmeter connected  to the  pipework, \nor removed  from it. Manufacturers  should  be  consulted \nfor the  various options available. \n6.5 Primary Device - \nMaterials of \nConstruction \n6.5.1 General Guidelines \nMaterials  used for  construction of process  wetted  parts \nmust be compatible with the  process. \nSafety  and  environmental  programs of end users  may \nrequire complete traceability of all process wetted and \ncontainment  materials \nused in the  manufacture \nof the \nprimary. \n6.5.2 Liner Materials \nWhen selecting a liner, the  process  liquid \nand any \ncleaning agents that will be  flowing  through  the  pipeline \n6 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Some  examples and  general appli- \ncation guidelines for liner  materials are  summarized in \nAppendix C.  These materials  have  generally  good  wear \nresistance. The manufacturer  should  be  contacted for the \nspecifications  and recommendations regarding  their  liner \nmaterials. \n6.5.3 Electrode Materials \nWhen  selecting an electrode,  the  process  liquid \nand \nany  cleaning \nagents that will be flowing through the \npipeline  must  be considered.  Examples of electrode ma- \nterials  include \nStainless Steel,  Hastelloy \nC, Platinum, \nPlatinum/Iridium, Tantalum,  Titanium,  and  Zirconium. \nManufacturers  should  be  contacted  for  specifications and \nrecommendations  regarding  their  electrode  materials. \n6.6 Secondary Device - \nInstallation \n6.6.1 Location of Secondary Device \nSecondary  devices  should be installed in an accessible \nposition with due regard  being  given to the manufactur- \ner’s  specifications. \n6.6.2 Electrical Installation \nThe  cables \ncarrying  the  electrode  signals  and  coil \ndrive and/or reference  signals  should  be \nof a type  ap- \nproved by the  manufacturer. \nCare should  be  taken to  ensure that signal cables  are \nnot routed in the same  conduits or wireways as high \nvoltage and/or high  current  carrying  cables.  Signal \nca- \nbles and  coil  drive and/or reference cables can  generally \nbe run in the same  conduit or wireway, but the  manu- \nfacturers’  instructions  should  be  followed for the  specific \ntype of flowmeter  system  being  installed. \nIf the equipment must  be  mounted \nin an area of po- \ntentially  high  electrical  interference,  the  signal,  coil, a n d  \nor reference  wiring  between the Primary  and a remotely \nmounted  Secondary  should  be  run \nin a conduit which is \nphysically  separated from high voltage and/or high cur- \nrent wiring  and equipment. \n6.7 Safety \n6.7.1 Electrical Safety \nThe primary and secondary  portions of the metering \nsystem  must  be designed, manufactured, and certified to \nmeet or exceed the  electrical  classification \nfor the  area \nin  which  installed. \nASME MFC-16M-1995 \nCabling Supplied by manufacturers to  connect \npri- \nmaries  and  secondaries  must  meet \nor  exceed area  elec- \ntrical  classifications  and  user \nsafety  codes.  The  cable \nused to connect the  meter  power  source  and  to connect \nthe  meter  output  signal to  the user’s  system  should also \nmeet area  electrical  classifications. \n6.7.2 Mechanical Safety \nThe Primary,  which is an integral  portion of the piping \nsystem, must  be designed, manufactured,  and certified to \nmeet or exceed  industry standards for piping codes (i.e., \nASME B 16 Series,  etc.)  and classifications. If this is not \nfeasible in a  given application,  the user  and  manufacturer \nmust  agree on what ratings are to apply. User  require- \nments for specific location piping  codes, material  trace- \nability, primary  cleanability,  x-rays,  etc.,  need \nto be ne- \ngotiated on an individual  basis  between  manufacturer \nand user. \nWhen using reducers and  expanders in the piping  sys- \ntem, the system  and drains  should be  designed so that \ntrapping of process fluids is avoided  and complete sys- \ntem  cleaning  needs  are \naddressed. \n7 EQUIPMENT MARKINGS \n7.1 Introduction \nThe Primary  and  Secondary  should  be  marked  either \ndirectly or on a name plate attached  thereto as indicated \nbelow. \n7.2 Primary Device \n7.2.1 Mandatory Information \n(a) Instrument  type and serial number \n(6) Liner  Material \n(c) Electrode  Material \n(d) Maximum  rated process temperature \n(e) Maximum  rated \nprocess pressure  (at  maximum \nv) Voltage, frequency, and power  requirements, if in- \n( g )  Enclosure  protection  rating \n(\\I) Flow direction  indication \nrated process temperature) \ndependently  powered \n7.2.2 Optional  Information \n(a) Nominal diameter \n(b) Meter  factor \n7 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

If this is not feasible, \nthe  user  must \nrely on a laboratory liquid calibration of \nthe  magnetic flowmeter. This calibration may be in the \nuser’s own  in-house  facility, that of the manufacturer, or \nan independent or  government testing  laboratory. \n8.2 Calibration Conditions \nThe Primary  should  be calibrated under  specified ref- \nerence  conditions.

Assume that a uniform  magnetic field (B) is ap- \nplied at right angles to the top and  bottom of the  conduit, \nand that the velocity profile of the conducting  liquid \nflowing full in the conduit is flat (i.e., a constant  axial \nvelocity (v)) over the entire cross-section. \nIn this  situation  the  Lorentz  force  acting on any given \ncharged  particle in the flowing liquid is the same and is \ngiven by Eq. (I), as shown by the  following: \nF, = q . B . v  \n(2) \nwhere \nF, = force on particle  moving  with liquid [newton], \nv = axial  liquid velocity [meter/second]. \nThis force is at right angles  to the  sides of the  conduit. \nThe work (W) done by the  Lorentz  force, \nif it were to \nmove one of these charges from  one side of the conduit \nto the other, is the  force (F,) times  the  distance \n(s), as \nshown by the following: \nW,, = FG = q * s * B * v  \n(3) \nwhere \nW, = work done by Lorentz. force (joule) \ns = width of conduit  (meter) \nHence, the electromotive  force \n(emf, (i.e., the work \nper unit charge) that this  device is capable of generating \nis as  follows: \nemfv = s * B \nv \n(4) \nwhere \nemf, = electromotive  force (volt) \nHence, for a fixed s and a known B, a measurement \nof the emjgenerated by the Lorentz  force (emfv) yields \na  measurement of the fluid velocity. \nIn typical  industrial  flowmeters  the conduit  is circular \nin  cross-section, the magnetic field is not uniform,  and \nthe liquid velocity profile is non-uniform  and a function \nof flow rate. Nevertheless, it can be  shown  theoretically \n(see Shercliff, J.A., Appendix D) and  demonstrated ex- \nperimentally that in this  general  situation  the \nemf gen- \nerated by the Lorentz force is given by the  following: \netnfv = C * D * Bo V \n(5) \nwhere \nemf, = electromotive force (volt) \nD = flowtube inner  diameter (meter) \n9 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Since its  magnitude can be comparable \nto emfv, a measurement  technique \nthat distinguishes \nemf, from emf, must be utilized. \nThe solution to this  problem,  which  takes \nadvantage \nof the  fact that the  electrochemical \nemf changes very \nslowly  with  time, is to vary the  magnetic field in a fixed \nperiodic  manner  (i.e., \nat a fixed frequency). The  elec- \ntronics in the  secondary device  are designed to  measure \nspecifically  this  time  varying component of the emf gen- \nerated in the  primary. To obtain  a  good \nflow measure- \nment, the  period of this  variation must be shorter  than \nthe  time it takes for emf, to drift to a detectable amount. \n10 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Uncontrolled w\n\nVarying the magnetic field to eliminate the effect of \nemfc introduces  yet another  source of emf, the induced \nemf (emf,), a  phenomenon commonly referred to as the \ntransformer  effect. This emf is equal in magnitude to the \nrate of change of the  magnetic \nflux through  the  area \ndefined by the  electrical connections leading  from the \nsecondary to the electrodes in  the  primary  device. \nThe influence of varying the magnetic field on the \nflow measurement  can  be  reduced \nto acceptable  levels \nby  appropriate measurement technqiues. In  the  case of \nAC meters emf, is 90 degrees out-of-phase (i.e., in quad- \nrature) with emfv and  hence its influence can be  reduced \nby phase  sensitive  detection techniques, using the phase \nof the  magnetic field, or a  related  electrical  quantity, \nas \nthe  reference. In the case of pulsed-DC  meters, the mea- \nsurement of e l ~ f ,  \nis made during  the  time  when the  mag- \nnetic field is,  ideally, not changing, and  hence emfi ap- \nproaches  zero. \n11 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

The chairman of the subcommittee is indebted to  the \nmany individuals who contributed to this  document. \nElectromagnetic  flowmeters  were first introduced to the  process  industries in the mid-1950’s. \nThey  quickly became an accepted flowmeter for difficult applications. Subsequent improve- \nments in technology  and  reductions \nin cost have transformed  this  flowmeter \ninto one of the \nleading contenders for general use in water based  and  other  electrically \nconducting liquid \napplications. \nDue to differences in design of the various  electromagnetic  flowmeters in the  marketplace, \nthis Standard  cannot  address  detailed  performance  limitations \nin specific applications. It does, \nhowever, cover  issues that are  common to all meters,  including  application  considerations. \nSuggestions for improvements to this  Standard  are encouraged.

It specifically does not apply to insertion \nor medical type  electromagnetic  flowmeters. It also does \nnot cover  applications of industrial flowmeters involving \nnonconductive  liquids or highly  conductive  liquids (i.e., \nliquid metals). \nThis  document  contains a  discussion of the theory and \nmeasurement  technique of an electromagnetic flowmeter, \na  physical  description of the  various  types  available,  ap- \nplication  considerations,  specifications as to what equip- \nment markings  should  reside \non the meter, and liquid \ncalibration  procedures. \n2 REFERENCES \nUnless  otherwise  indicated,  the  latest  issue of the  fol- \nlowing  American  National  Standards \nshall be used. \nASME  B16 \nSeries,  Standards \nfor Valves, Fittings, \nFlanges,  and  Gaskets \nASME  MFC-IM, \nGlossary of Terms Used in the \nMeasurement of Fluid Flow in Pipes \nASME  MFC-2M, Measurement  Uncertainty for Fluid \nFlow in Closed Conduits \nASME  MFC-9M,  Measurement \nof Liquid Flow in \nClosed  Conduits by Weighing  Method \nASME MFC-IOM, Method for  Establishing  Installa- \ntion Effects on Flowmeters \nAWWA C207, Steel  Pipe  Flanges for Waterworks Ser- \nvice (Sizes 4 in. through 144 in.) \nSee Appendix D for other applicable  standards. \n3 TERMINOLOGY \nDefinitions  stated in ASME  MFC-IM and  MFC-2M \napply to this Standard.  Those definitions  particularly per- \ntinent to this document  are listed below, in  most cases \nin an expanded  form. \naccuracy (also referred to  as Measurement  Uncertainty, \nsee ASME  MFC-2M) - the  accuracy of a flowmeter, \nexpressed  as  a  percentage,  gives  the  maximum  expected \nplus or minus  deviation between the meter’s indication \nand  the  estimated \ntrue value of the  flow  rate. \nIt is the \ninterval within which  the  true value of a  measured  quan- \ntity can  be  expected \nto lie with  a  specified  confidence \nlevel. It is a  combination of random and systematic un- \ncertainties.  Refer to  ASME  MFC-2M  for the  procedures \nfor calculating and combining random and systematic \nuncertainties. \nbias (also referred to as  Systematic \nUncertainty,  see \nASME  MFC-2M) - the uncertainty  associated \nwith \nsystematic errors (i.e., those that cannot  be  reduced \nby \nincreasing the number of measurements taken under \nfixed flow conditions) \nlinearity - \nthe  maximum  deviation,  expressed  as  a per- \ncentage, of the  calibration \ncurve  from \na  straight \nline \npassing  through  zero  and coinciding with the  calibration \ncurve at the upper  range  value.

The largest value obtained over the \nfull flow range is the  meter’s  stated repeatability. \n4 THEORY AND  MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE \nThe basic  principle on which all electromagnetic flow- \nmeters are based is the Lorentz Force law (see A1 of \nAppendix A).  Consider the  electromagnetic \nflowmeter \nconfigurations  shown in Fig. 1. A  magnetic field (B) has \nbeen applied at right angles to the pipe axis in which  a \nconducting fluid is flowing. In addition,  two  electrodes \nhave been placed on opposite sides of the pipe wall \nalong a line that is at  right angles to both the pipe axis \nand  the  magnetic \nfield. The  Lorentz Force law applied \nto these  configuratlons  leads \nto an electromotive force \n(emfv) (i.e., a flow signal) being  generated  between  the \nelectrodes,  which is given by the  following: \nenfv = C . D . B,, \n* V \nwhere \nemf, = electromotive  force  (volt) \nD = flowtube  inner diameter  (meter) \nBo = magnetic field at the  center of the flowtube \nV = flow velocity (average liquid velocity over the \n(tesla) \ncross-section)  (meter/second) \nC = a dimensionless  parameter that depends on the \nspecific design of the  flowmeter  and to a lim- \nited extent on the  velocity profile. The veloc- \nity profile sensitivity of C also depends  on the \nspecific design of the  flowmeter (see  Sections \n6.2.2 and  6.4.1.1). \nIn addition to the  above  flow-related  electromotive \nforce (emf,), an electrochemical  electromotive  force \nemfc \nis also produced in the  flowtube. The magnitude \nof e&, \nwhich changes very slowly in time,  can  be com- \nparable to emf,. To reduce  the  influence of emf, on the \nflow measurement to acceptable levels, all electromag- \nnetic flowmeters  operate  with  time  varying  magnetic \nfields. The measurement electronics is designed to look \nspecifically at this  time  varying component of the  signal \ncoming  from the flowtube (for additional  details, see  A2 \nof Appendix A). \nPresent  commercial  meters \nfall into two  groups ac- \ncording to the  manner \nin which the magnetic field is \nvaried. It is termed an AC meter if the field is varied \nsinusoidally (see Fig. 2(a)), a pulsed-DC  meter \nif it is \nvaried in a  stepwise  fashion (see Figs. 2(b)  and  (c)). \nThe fact that time  varying flow related signals  are be- \ning generated  means  that, \nin principle, either wetted or \nnon-wetted (i.e., capacitive)  sensing \nelectrodes  can be \nused in the flowmeter to detect  the \nflow signal  (see \nFig. 1). \n5 FLOWMETER DESCRIPTION \n5.1 Overview \nThe electromagnetic  flowmeter \nconsists of two \nelements: \n2 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

It also includes  magnetic \nfield coils and two or \nmore  sensing  electrodes \nthat may be wetted or non- \nwetted (see Fig. 1).

The coils may be either AC \n6.2.2 Velocity Profile Effect \nor pulsed-DC  powered, depending on the design of the \nmeter. \nDistortions in velocity profiles may be caused by pipe \nfittings (bends, valves,  reducers, etc.) placed upstream or \ndownstream  from  the flowmeter. The resulting flow pat- \nterns may influence  the  performance \nof the  meter (see \n5.4 Outputs from \n \nthe \nSecondary \nSection 6.4. I. I). \nThe output  from  the Secondary may be'an analog  sig- \nnal (i.e., 4-20 ma DC), a pulse  output  (frequency), or a \ndigital  signal. The pulse output may be scaled or un- \nscaled. Other optional outputs include  solid-state or me- \nchanical  contact closures.  Some  designs \nalso offer  the \noption of local visual indication of rate of flow and/or \ntotalized flow. \n6 APPLICATION CONSIDERATIONS \n6.1 Process Liquid \n6.1.1 Liquid Electrical Conductivity \n6.2.3 Slippage \nThe solids in a slurry may move at a  different  velocity \nthan the liquid  (Le.,  slippage may occur). In vertical  in- \nstallations  settling  solids \nin a slurry may appear as re- \nverse flow if the  normal \nflow direction is up, and as \nforward flow if the  normal flow is down.  Depending on \nthe  application,  slippage may affect  the  relationship  be- \ntween the meter  output  and  the  quantity of interest. Con- \nsult the manufacturer  for all slurry  applications. \n6.3 Primary Device - \nSizing Considerations \nIf the  electrical  conductivity of the liquid is uniform, \nthe meter  output is generally  independent of the liquid \n6.3.1 General Considerations \nconductivity  when the latter is above  a  specified \nmini- \nmum value. The minimum liquid conductivity  should be \nobtained from the  manufacturer. \nIf, however, the conductivity is not uniform through- \nout the meter, errors may occur. Non-homogeneous \nstreams, such  as blends,  should be sufficiently mixed so \nas to have uniform electrical  conductivity \nin the mea- \nsurement  region. \nA heterogeneous  liquid,  such \nas a \nslurry, composed  of small  particles  uniformly  distributed \nin a medium  can \nbe considered an electrically  homo- \ngeneous liquid. \n6.1.2 Noisy Flow Signal \nMagnetic  flowmeters  have  high  inherent  rangeability. \nTherefore, it is normally  feasible to select  a  primary of \nthe same nominal  size as the  connecting  pipe.  When  this \nis the case, the  pressure drop through  the  Primary \ncan \nbe considered  the same as that of an;equivalent  length \nof pipe. This sizing  ability  usually  affords  a \nprocess \nfriendly installation,  particularly with regard to the mea- \nsurement of abrasive  and  fast-settling  slurry \nflows. \nIt should be noted, however, that for small  meters (1/2 \nin. and under) the  meter bore diameter is normally  based \non fluid flow rate  considerations  rather  than  pipe  size. \n6.3.2 Special Process Considerations \nExcessive  signal  noise \nmay be encountered when \nThere may be situations  where it  is desirable to size \nmeasuring some slurry flows, particularly with pulsed- \nthe flowmeter at other than the \npipe  size. \nWhen \nnmse emanates from different sources at varying fre- \nquencies and  intensities. \nThe manufacturer  should \nbe \nconsulted  for \nrecommendations when a noisy output  sig- \n6.3.2.1 Accuracy.

Uncontrolled w\n\nMEASUREMENT OF FLUID FLOW IN CLOSED CONDUITS \nBY MEANS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC  FLOWMETERS \nASME MFC-16M-1995 \n6.3.2.3 Abrasive Slurries. Excessive  liner  wear \nmay be  a  consideration for increasing  the  meter  size \nio \nlower the liquid velocity. However,  excessive  liner  wear \nmay be  caused  more \nby an asymmetrical flow profile \n(see Section 6.2.2), improper  liner  material  selection  (see \nSection  6.S.2), or horizontal  installation of the  Primary \n(see Section 6.4.1 .S(a)). \nIn particular,  the  leading edge (i.e., upstream edge) of \nthe  liner may be subject to wear from abrasive  slurries. \nIf this is the case, it may be beneficial to match, if pos- \nsible,  the  inside diameter of the  Primary with the inside \ndiameter of the pipe to reduce  wear of the  leading edge. \nMetal protection  rings,  which can also act  as  grounding \nrings,  can also be  installed to reduce  this  effect. \n6.3.2.4  Fast-Settling Slurries. Velocities must \nbe  high  enough to keep  slurry  solids in suspension when \nthe Primary is mounted  horizontally.  Settling may occur \nif the  Primary is sized  larger than the  pipeline.  Also, \nif \nsolids  settle \nduring no-flow conditions, there must be \nsufficient velocity to purge  the  Primary \nof sediment at \nstart-up (see Section  6.4.1 .S(b)). \n6.4 Primary Device - \nLocation, Installation, \nand  Maintenance \n6.4.1 Primary Device Location and  Orientation \nThere are no inherent  restrictions on horizontal or ver- \ntical mounting of the  device.  However, the performance \nof magnetic  flowmeters may be influenced by the loca- \ntion and orientation of the  primary  device in the piping \nsystem.  The following  points  should be considered. \n6.4.1.1 Piping Effects. Ideally, the Primary is de- \nsigned so that the  performance of the flowmeter is the \nsame regardless of flow profile. In practice, when a flow \nvelocity profile is significantly  different  from that in the \noriginal  calibration, an electromagnetic flowmeter may \nexhibit a change in performance. The arrangement  and \nlocation of pipe fittings,  valves, \npumps,  etc., \nup and \ndownstream  (especially  upstream) of the primary device, \nare  the main factors that influence  the velocity profile. \nComplete data on the  effects of flow disturbances may \nnot always be available.  Nevertheless,  manufacturers \nusually recommend  specific  upstream \nand downstream \nlengths of straight pipe of the same nominal  diameter as \nthe Primary for proper  performance. \nSwirling flow, such  as that produced by two out-of- \nplane elbows located  upstream of the Primary, may in- \ntroduce  measurement errors. When  swirling flow  is sus- \npected or known, it is advisable, if practical, to use a \nswirl  reducing \nflow conditioner. Otherwise, it may be \nnecessary to relocate  the  Primary \nwhere  swirl is not a \nfactor. \n6.4.1.2 Full Pipe Requirements. The primary \ndevice  should be mounted in such a position that it is \ncompletely filled with the liquid  being  metered.  Other- \nwise,  this  Standard  does not apply, and the  measurement \nmay not be within the  manufacturer’s  stated accuracy. It \nmay, for  example, be difficult to  assure a full pipe in a \nvertical-down flow situation. \n6.4.1.3 Electrode Position - Horizontal In- \nstallations. Since  gas bubbles in a horizontal pipe tend \nto rise and may collect at the top of the  pipe, the primary \ndevice  should  be  mounted so that no sensing or ground- \ning electrodes are located at or near  the  top of the  pipe. \n6.4.1.4  In-Situ Zero Checking. If it is desired \nto check the flowmeter zero in-situ, a method must be \nprovided to stop the flow through the primary device, \nleaving it filled with stationary  liquid. \n6.4.1.5 Entrained Solids (Slurries). There are \ntwo  major  location  and  installation  considerations  for the \nmeasurement of liquids containing entrained  solids  (i.e., \nslurries). The manufacturer  should be consulted for all \nslurry  applications. \n(a) Abrasive Slurries. Abrasive  slurries  can cause un- \neven or excessive  liner \nwear. On the  premise \nthat a \nproper choice of liner is made (see Section  6.5.2), an \nimportant  factor in reducing  liner  wear is to have suffi- \ncient  straight length of upstream  piping to ensure that a \nsymmetrical velocity profile exists within the Primary \n(see  Section 6.4.1.1).  This tends to minimize  localized \nerosion of the liner. \nIn addition, since slurry  solids  tend to move along  the \nbottom of a horizontal pipe, excessive liner wear may \noccur in the  bottom of a horizontally  mounted Primary, \nparticularly with  highly  abrasive  slurries. \nVertical \nmounting of the primary device can prevent this situation \n(see  Section  6.2.3). \n(b) Solids Settling-Our. Under flowing conditions, \npipeline  velocities  should  be \nhigh enough to avoid set- \ntling of solids  (see  Section \n6.3.2.3).  Smooth transitions \nbetween the pipe and  the  Primary  can  reduce  settling. \nWhen  the flow stops, however, solids may settle out in \nthe Primary. Vertical mounting of the flowmeter can \navoid this  problem (see Section  6.2.3). \n6.4.1.6 Location with Regard to Electrical \nInterference. Under  most field situations,  electrical in- \nterference is not a problem.  However, \nif feasible,  the \nPrimary  should be installed in an area  where  minimal \n5 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Uncontrolled w\n\nASME  MFC-16M-1995 \nelectrical  interference,  which may result  from  equipment \noperating at high  voltage \nand/or high  current, \nis \nexpected. \nWhen  this is not possible  with  remotely  mounted Sec- \nondaries, the Primary and  Secondary should  be  located \nso that the  signal cable is run in conduit, which  can be \nseparated  from  wiring that is at  high voltage and/or car- \nries  high current. \nSome installations such as  electrolytic  processes, \nwhere  high currents may  be  flowing  through  the  piping \nand  the  liquid (and, consequently,  through  the  Primary) \nhave inherently high electrical  interferences. The man- \nufacturer  should  be  contacted for specific  grounding  and \npossibly  isolation  procedure(s) in these  situations. \n6.4.2 Installation of Primary Device \n6.4.2.1 Installation Design. When  designing the \npiping system, access  for installing  and  removing  the \nprimary device, as well as access  to the electrical  con- \nnections,  should  be  provided. Care should be taken  dur- \ning pipework construction to minimize  the  strain on the \nprimary device either  during or after  installation. \n6.4.2.2  Handling of the Primary Device. Care \nshould be taken  when  handling \nthe primary  device. \nSlings around the  primary device, or lifting  lugs,  should \nbe used on large  primary devices. Lifting by any means \nthat could damage the  liner  should be avoided. \n6.4.2.3  Pipework  Alignment  and \nConnect- \nors. Allowance  should  be \nmade for the length- of the \nPrimary,  the gaskets, and  the alignment of the  Primary \nwith the connecting pipe. \n6.4.2.4 Transition Piping. When the connecting \npipe is of a  different  size than the  Primary, it is advisable \nto use concentric reducers  upstream  and  downstream \nof \nthe Primary to affect a gradual transition  from one di- \nameter to another. In most applications,  this  should \nre- \nduce pressure loss and flow disturbance effects.  Unless \nthese  reducers \nhave a relatively shallow  taper  (typical \nmanufacturers’ recommendations vary from 8 to 15 de- \ngrees  maximum  included angle), they should be installed \nat locations  that  permit  the  manufacturers’  normal \nup- \nstream  and  downstream  straight \npipe run recommenda- \ntions to be followed.  Consult  the  manufacturer  for other \ntypes of transition  piping. \n6.4.3 Electrical Installation \n6.4.3.1  General \nRequirements. The metered \nliquid,  the  primary  device \nbody, and  the  secondary \nshould  be at the same potential,  preferably earth poten- \nMEASUREMENT  OF  FLUID  FLOW  IN CLOSED CONDUITS \nBY MEANS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC  FLOWMETERS \ntial. The manufacturer’s  instructions  should be carefully \nfollowed for interconnections  between  the  primary \nand \nsecondary  device. \nThe electrical  connection between  the liquid and  the \nprimary  device  body \nmay be made by contact  with  the \nconnecting  pipework, or by conductive grounding  (earth- \ning)  rings or electrodes.  When  lined \nor nonconductive \npipework is used, the manufacturer’s recommendations \nshould  be  adhered to, since  proper  grounding  (earthing) \nis very important. \n6.4.3.2 Power Factor (AC Systems  Only). Be- \ncause the  Primary has  coils  to  provide  the magnetic field, \nit may have a low power factor. To improve  the  power \nfactor, capacitors may be connected in parallel  with  the \nsupply by arrangement  with the manufacturer. \n6.4.3.3 Cathodic Protection. When  an  electro- \nmagnetic  flowmeter  primary device is installed in a ca- \nthodic  protected  pipeline,  precautions \nmay be  necessary \nto ensure that the  DC  component of the cathodic  current \ndoes not affect the accuracy  and  stability \nof the flow- \nmeter  system. In such a case, relevant  electric codes and \nmanufacturer’s recommendations should  be  consulted. \n6.4.4 Coatings and Deposits \nIf insulating or conducting materials are  deposited \nfrom  the  process  liquid \nonto the electrodes or the walls \nof the  meter tube, the performance of the  meter may be \naffected. In such  situations,  provision  should  be \nmade \nfor cleaning the electrodes, by either electrical, chemical, \nultrasonic, or mechanical  methods. This can  be accom- \nplished with the  flowmeter connected  to the  pipework, \nor removed  from it. Manufacturers  should  be  consulted \nfor the  various options available. \n6.5 Primary Device - \nMaterials of \nConstruction \n6.5.1 General Guidelines \nMaterials  used for  construction of process  wetted  parts \nmust be compatible with the  process. \nSafety  and  environmental  programs of end users  may \nrequire complete traceability of all process wetted and \ncontainment  materials \nused in the  manufacture \nof the \nprimary. \n6.5.2 Liner Materials \nWhen selecting a liner, the  process  liquid \nand any \ncleaning agents that will be  flowing  through  the  pipeline \n6 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Some  examples and  general appli- \ncation guidelines for liner  materials are  summarized in \nAppendix C.  These materials  have  generally  good  wear \nresistance. The manufacturer  should  be  contacted for the \nspecifications  and recommendations regarding  their  liner \nmaterials. \n6.5.3 Electrode Materials \nWhen  selecting an electrode,  the  process  liquid \nand \nany  cleaning \nagents that will be flowing through the \npipeline  must  be considered.  Examples of electrode ma- \nterials  include \nStainless Steel,  Hastelloy \nC, Platinum, \nPlatinum/Iridium, Tantalum,  Titanium,  and  Zirconium. \nManufacturers  should  be  contacted  for  specifications and \nrecommendations  regarding  their  electrode  materials. \n6.6 Secondary Device - \nInstallation \n6.6.1 Location of Secondary Device \nSecondary  devices  should be installed in an accessible \nposition with due regard  being  given to the manufactur- \ner’s  specifications. \n6.6.2 Electrical Installation \nThe  cables \ncarrying  the  electrode  signals  and  coil \ndrive and/or reference  signals  should  be \nof a type  ap- \nproved by the  manufacturer. \nCare should  be  taken to  ensure that signal cables  are \nnot routed in the same  conduits or wireways as high \nvoltage and/or high  current  carrying  cables.  Signal \nca- \nbles and  coil  drive and/or reference cables can  generally \nbe run in the same  conduit or wireway, but the  manu- \nfacturers’  instructions  should  be  followed for the  specific \ntype of flowmeter  system  being  installed. \nIf the equipment must  be  mounted \nin an area of po- \ntentially  high  electrical  interference,  the  signal,  coil, a n d  \nor reference  wiring  between the Primary  and a remotely \nmounted  Secondary  should  be  run \nin a conduit which is \nphysically  separated from high voltage and/or high cur- \nrent wiring  and equipment. \n6.7 Safety \n6.7.1 Electrical Safety \nThe primary and secondary  portions of the metering \nsystem  must  be designed, manufactured, and certified to \nmeet or exceed the  electrical  classification \nfor the  area \nin  which  installed. \nASME MFC-16M-1995 \nCabling Supplied by manufacturers to  connect \npri- \nmaries  and  secondaries  must  meet \nor  exceed area  elec- \ntrical  classifications  and  user \nsafety  codes.  The  cable \nused to connect the  meter  power  source  and  to connect \nthe  meter  output  signal to  the user’s  system  should also \nmeet area  electrical  classifications. \n6.7.2 Mechanical Safety \nThe Primary,  which is an integral  portion of the piping \nsystem, must  be designed, manufactured,  and certified to \nmeet or exceed  industry standards for piping codes (i.e., \nASME B 16 Series,  etc.)  and classifications. If this is not \nfeasible in a  given application,  the user  and  manufacturer \nmust  agree on what ratings are to apply. User  require- \nments for specific location piping  codes, material  trace- \nability, primary  cleanability,  x-rays,  etc.,  need \nto be ne- \ngotiated on an individual  basis  between  manufacturer \nand user. \nWhen using reducers and  expanders in the piping  sys- \ntem, the system  and drains  should be  designed so that \ntrapping of process fluids is avoided  and complete sys- \ntem  cleaning  needs  are \naddressed. \n7 EQUIPMENT MARKINGS \n7.1 Introduction \nThe Primary  and  Secondary  should  be  marked  either \ndirectly or on a name plate attached  thereto as indicated \nbelow. \n7.2 Primary Device \n7.2.1 Mandatory Information \n(a) Instrument  type and serial number \n(6) Liner  Material \n(c) Electrode  Material \n(d) Maximum  rated process temperature \n(e) Maximum  rated \nprocess pressure  (at  maximum \nv) Voltage, frequency, and power  requirements, if in- \n( g )  Enclosure  protection  rating \n(\\I) Flow direction  indication \nrated process temperature) \ndependently  powered \n7.2.2 Optional  Information \n(a) Nominal diameter \n(b) Meter  factor \n7 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

If this is not feasible, \nthe  user  must \nrely on a laboratory liquid calibration of \nthe  magnetic flowmeter. This calibration may be in the \nuser’s own  in-house  facility, that of the manufacturer, or \nan independent or  government testing  laboratory. \n8.2 Calibration Conditions \nThe Primary  should  be calibrated under  specified ref- \nerence  conditions.  The  ambient temperature  range,  liquid \ntemperature  range,  liquid  conductivity  range,  supply \nvoltage, and the  pipeline diameter should  be  given  as the \nreference conditions. \nThe user may want to request a system  calibration in \nwhich  the  Primary \nand  Secondary are  calibrated \nas a \nunit. This may result in improved  accuracy. \n8.3 Calibration Facilities \nThe flowmeter  calibration  facilities  should \nbe either \ngravimetric or volumetric  based,  and  shall  be  traceable \nto  NIST or some  other recognized  national or interna- \ntional standard. Measurement  and test equipment  used \nduring the calibration  shall also have traceability. \nThe standard (either primary,  secondary, or transfer) \nused in the calibration of the magnetic  flowmeter  should \n8.4 Calibration of the Primary \nThe Primary  shall \nbe calibrated in accordance with \nSection 8.3, either by itself or together with the user’s \nSecondary.

Assume that a uniform  magnetic field (B) is ap- \nplied at right angles to the top and  bottom of the  conduit, \nand that the velocity profile of the conducting  liquid \nflowing full in the conduit is flat (i.e., a constant  axial \nvelocity (v)) over the entire cross-section. \nIn this  situation  the  Lorentz  force  acting on any given \ncharged  particle in the flowing liquid is the same and is \ngiven by Eq. (I), as shown by the  following: \nF, = q . B . v  \n(2) \nwhere \nF, = force on particle  moving  with liquid [newton], \nv = axial  liquid velocity [meter/second]. \nThis force is at right angles  to the  sides of the  conduit. \nThe work (W) done by the  Lorentz  force, \nif it were to \nmove one of these charges from  one side of the conduit \nto the other, is the  force (F,) times  the  distance \n(s), as \nshown by the following: \nW,, = FG = q * s * B * v  \n(3) \nwhere \nW, = work done by Lorentz. force (joule) \ns = width of conduit  (meter) \nHence, the electromotive  force \n(emf, (i.e., the work \nper unit charge) that this  device is capable of generating \nis as  follows: \nemfv = s * B \nv \n(4) \nwhere \nemf, = electromotive  force (volt) \nHence, for a fixed s and a known B, a measurement \nof the emjgenerated by the Lorentz  force (emfv) yields \na  measurement of the fluid velocity. \nIn typical  industrial  flowmeters  the conduit  is circular \nin  cross-section, the magnetic field is not uniform,  and \nthe liquid velocity profile is non-uniform  and a function \nof flow rate. Nevertheless, it can be  shown  theoretically \n(see Shercliff, J.A., Appendix D) and  demonstrated ex- \nperimentally that in this  general  situation  the \nemf gen- \nerated by the Lorentz force is given by the  following: \netnfv = C * D * Bo V \n(5) \nwhere \nemf, = electromotive force (volt) \nD = flowtube inner  diameter (meter) \n9 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Since its  magnitude can be comparable \nto emfv, a measurement  technique \nthat distinguishes \nemf, from emf, must be utilized. \nThe solution to this  problem,  which  takes \nadvantage \nof the  fact that the  electrochemical \nemf changes very \nslowly  with  time, is to vary the  magnetic field in a fixed \nperiodic  manner  (i.e., \nat a fixed frequency). The  elec- \ntronics in the  secondary device  are designed to  measure \nspecifically  this  time  varying component of the emf gen- \nerated in the  primary. To obtain  a  good \nflow measure- \nment, the  period of this  variation must be shorter  than \nthe  time it takes for emf, to drift to a detectable amount. \n10 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Uncontrolled w\n\nVarying the magnetic field to eliminate the effect of \nemfc introduces  yet another  source of emf, the induced \nemf (emf,), a  phenomenon commonly referred to as the \ntransformer  effect. This emf is equal in magnitude to the \nrate of change of the  magnetic \nflux through  the  area \ndefined by the  electrical connections leading  from the \nsecondary to the electrodes in  the  primary  device. \nThe influence of varying the magnetic field on the \nflow measurement  can  be  reduced \nto acceptable  levels \nby  appropriate measurement technqiues. In  the  case of \nAC meters emf, is 90 degrees out-of-phase (i.e., in quad- \nrature) with emfv and  hence its influence can be  reduced \nby phase  sensitive  detection techniques, using the phase \nof the  magnetic field, or a  related  electrical  quantity, \nas \nthe  reference. In the case of pulsed-DC  meters, the mea- \nsurement of e l ~ f ,  \nis made during  the  time  when the  mag- \nnetic field is,  ideally, not changing, and  hence emfi ap- \nproaches  zero. \n11 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Uncontrolled w\n\n(This Foreword is not part of ASME  MFC-16M-1995.) \nThis Standard  was prepared by Subcommittee 5 of the ASME  Committee on the  Measure- \nment of Fluid Flow in Closed  Conduits. The chairman of the subcommittee is indebted to  the \nmany individuals who contributed to this  document. \nElectromagnetic  flowmeters  were first introduced to the  process  industries in the mid-1950’s. \nThey  quickly became an accepted flowmeter for difficult applications. Subsequent improve- \nments in technology  and  reductions \nin cost have transformed  this  flowmeter \ninto one of the \nleading contenders for general use in water based  and  other  electrically \nconducting liquid \napplications. \nDue to differences in design of the various  electromagnetic  flowmeters in the  marketplace, \nthis Standard  cannot  address  detailed  performance  limitations \nin specific applications. It does, \nhowever, cover  issues that are  common to all meters,  including  application  considerations. \nSuggestions for improvements to this  Standard  are encouraged. They  should  be sent to the \nSecretary, ASME  MFC Main Committee,  The American  Society of Mechanical  Engineers, 345 \nEast  47th Street, New York, N.Y. 10017. \nThis Standard was approved by the  American  National  Standards  Institute \n(ANSI) on April \n14, 1995. \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

It specifically does not apply to insertion \nor medical type  electromagnetic  flowmeters. It also does \nnot cover  applications of industrial flowmeters involving \nnonconductive  liquids or highly  conductive  liquids (i.e., \nliquid metals). \nThis  document  contains a  discussion of the theory and \nmeasurement  technique of an electromagnetic flowmeter, \na  physical  description of the  various  types  available,  ap- \nplication  considerations,  specifications as to what equip- \nment markings  should  reside \non the meter, and liquid \ncalibration  procedures. \n2 REFERENCES \nUnless  otherwise  indicated,  the  latest  issue of the  fol- \nlowing  American  National  Standards \nshall be used. \nASME  B16 \nSeries,  Standards \nfor Valves, Fittings, \nFlanges,  and  Gaskets \nASME  MFC-IM, \nGlossary of Terms Used in the \nMeasurement of Fluid Flow in Pipes \nASME  MFC-2M, Measurement  Uncertainty for Fluid \nFlow in Closed Conduits \nASME  MFC-9M,  Measurement \nof Liquid Flow in \nClosed  Conduits by Weighing  Method \nASME MFC-IOM, Method for  Establishing  Installa- \ntion Effects on Flowmeters \nAWWA C207, Steel  Pipe  Flanges for Waterworks Ser- \nvice (Sizes 4 in. through 144 in.) \nSee Appendix D for other applicable  standards. \n3 TERMINOLOGY \nDefinitions  stated in ASME  MFC-IM and  MFC-2M \napply to this Standard.  Those definitions  particularly per- \ntinent to this document  are listed below, in  most cases \nin an expanded  form. \naccuracy (also referred to  as Measurement  Uncertainty, \nsee ASME  MFC-2M) - the  accuracy of a flowmeter, \nexpressed  as  a  percentage,  gives  the  maximum  expected \nplus or minus  deviation between the meter’s indication \nand  the  estimated \ntrue value of the  flow  rate. \nIt is the \ninterval within which  the  true value of a  measured  quan- \ntity can  be  expected \nto lie with  a  specified  confidence \nlevel. It is a  combination of random and systematic un- \ncertainties.  Refer to  ASME  MFC-2M  for the  procedures \nfor calculating and combining random and systematic \nuncertainties. \nbias (also referred to as  Systematic \nUncertainty,  see \nASME  MFC-2M) - the uncertainty  associated \nwith \nsystematic errors (i.e., those that cannot  be  reduced \nby \nincreasing the number of measurements taken under \nfixed flow conditions) \nlinearity - \nthe  maximum  deviation,  expressed  as  a per- \ncentage, of the  calibration \ncurve  from \na  straight \nline \npassing  through  zero  and coinciding with the  calibration \ncurve at the upper  range  value.  Linearity, \nif stated,  ap- \nplies  only  above  a  specified \nflow rate. \nprecision (also referred to as Random  Uncertainty, see \nASME  MFC-2M) - the  precision of a flowmeter, ex- \npressed as a  plus or minus  percent  deviation  about  the \nmean measured value, gives  the \ninterval within which \nrepeated  measured \nflow values taken under fixed flow \nconditions  should lie with a specified confidence level. \nIt is a  measure of the random  errors. \nprimary meter factor (also referred to as  Meter  Factor) \n- \nthe  number,  determined by liquid calibration, that en- \nables  the  output \nflow signal to be related to the volu- \nmetric flow rate under defined reference  conditions. \nrangeability (see  ASME  MFC- I M) - \nflowmeter  range- \nability is the  ratio of the  maximum \nto minimum flow \nrates in the  range over which  the  meter  meets  a specified \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

The largest value obtained over the \nfull flow range is the  meter’s  stated repeatability. \n4 THEORY AND  MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE \nThe basic  principle on which all electromagnetic flow- \nmeters are based is the Lorentz Force law (see A1 of \nAppendix A).  Consider the  electromagnetic \nflowmeter \nconfigurations  shown in Fig. 1. A  magnetic field (B) has \nbeen applied at right angles to the pipe axis in which  a \nconducting fluid is flowing. In addition,  two  electrodes \nhave been placed on opposite sides of the pipe wall \nalong a line that is at  right angles to both the pipe axis \nand  the  magnetic \nfield. The  Lorentz Force law applied \nto these  configuratlons  leads \nto an electromotive force \n(emfv) (i.e., a flow signal) being  generated  between  the \nelectrodes,  which is given by the  following: \nenfv = C . D . B,, \n* V \nwhere \nemf, = electromotive  force  (volt) \nD = flowtube  inner diameter  (meter) \nBo = magnetic field at the  center of the flowtube \nV = flow velocity (average liquid velocity over the \n(tesla) \ncross-section)  (meter/second) \nC = a dimensionless  parameter that depends on the \nspecific design of the  flowmeter  and to a lim- \nited extent on the  velocity profile. The veloc- \nity profile sensitivity of C also depends  on the \nspecific design of the  flowmeter (see  Sections \n6.2.2 and  6.4.1.1). \nIn addition to the  above  flow-related  electromotive \nforce (emf,), an electrochemical  electromotive  force \nemfc \nis also produced in the  flowtube. The magnitude \nof e&, \nwhich changes very slowly in time,  can  be com- \nparable to emf,. To reduce  the  influence of emf, on the \nflow measurement to acceptable levels, all electromag- \nnetic flowmeters  operate  with  time  varying  magnetic \nfields. The measurement electronics is designed to look \nspecifically at this  time  varying component of the  signal \ncoming  from the flowtube (for additional  details, see  A2 \nof Appendix A). \nPresent  commercial  meters \nfall into two  groups ac- \ncording to the  manner \nin which the magnetic field is \nvaried. It is termed an AC meter if the field is varied \nsinusoidally (see Fig. 2(a)), a pulsed-DC  meter \nif it is \nvaried in a  stepwise  fashion (see Figs. 2(b)  and  (c)). \nThe fact that time  varying flow related signals  are be- \ning generated  means  that, \nin principle, either wetted or \nnon-wetted (i.e., capacitive)  sensing \nelectrodes  can be \nused in the flowmeter to detect  the \nflow signal  (see \nFig. 1). \n5 FLOWMETER DESCRIPTION \n5.1 Overview \nThe electromagnetic  flowmeter \nconsists of two \nelements: \n2 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

If the  Secondary \nis \nmounted  remotely  from the Primary, it may be necessary \nto have a  separate  electrical  connection  housing,  termin- \nals, and pre-amplifier  mounted \non the Primary, if re- \nquired by the  design of the electronics.

The coils may be either AC \n6.2.2 Velocity Profile Effect \nor pulsed-DC  powered, depending on the design of the \nmeter. \nDistortions in velocity profiles may be caused by pipe \nfittings (bends, valves,  reducers, etc.) placed upstream or \ndownstream  from  the flowmeter. The resulting flow pat- \nterns may influence  the  performance \nof the  meter (see \n5.4 Outputs from \n \nthe \nSecondary \nSection 6.4. I. I). \nThe output  from  the Secondary may be'an analog  sig- \nnal (i.e., 4-20 ma DC), a pulse  output  (frequency), or a \ndigital  signal. The pulse output may be scaled or un- \nscaled. Other optional outputs include  solid-state or me- \nchanical  contact closures.  Some  designs \nalso offer  the \noption of local visual indication of rate of flow and/or \ntotalized flow. \n6 APPLICATION CONSIDERATIONS \n6.1 Process Liquid \n6.1.1 Liquid Electrical Conductivity \n6.2.3 Slippage \nThe solids in a slurry may move at a  different  velocity \nthan the liquid  (Le.,  slippage may occur). In vertical  in- \nstallations  settling  solids \nin a slurry may appear as re- \nverse flow if the  normal \nflow direction is up, and as \nforward flow if the  normal flow is down.  Depending on \nthe  application,  slippage may affect  the  relationship  be- \ntween the meter  output  and  the  quantity of interest. Con- \nsult the manufacturer  for all slurry  applications. \n6.3 Primary Device - \nSizing Considerations \nIf the  electrical  conductivity of the liquid is uniform, \nthe meter  output is generally  independent of the liquid \n6.3.1 General Considerations \nconductivity  when the latter is above  a  specified \nmini- \nmum value. The minimum liquid conductivity  should be \nobtained from the  manufacturer. \nIf, however, the conductivity is not uniform through- \nout the meter, errors may occur. Non-homogeneous \nstreams, such  as blends,  should be sufficiently mixed so \nas to have uniform electrical  conductivity \nin the mea- \nsurement  region. \nA heterogeneous  liquid,  such \nas a \nslurry, composed  of small  particles  uniformly  distributed \nin a medium  can \nbe considered an electrically  homo- \ngeneous liquid. \n6.1.2 Noisy Flow Signal \nMagnetic  flowmeters  have  high  inherent  rangeability. \nTherefore, it is normally  feasible to select  a  primary of \nthe same nominal  size as the  connecting  pipe.  When  this \nis the case, the  pressure drop through  the  Primary \ncan \nbe considered  the same as that of an;equivalent  length \nof pipe. This sizing  ability  usually  affords  a \nprocess \nfriendly installation,  particularly with regard to the mea- \nsurement of abrasive  and  fast-settling  slurry \nflows. \nIt should be noted, however, that for small  meters (1/2 \nin. and under) the  meter bore diameter is normally  based \non fluid flow rate  considerations  rather  than  pipe  size. \n6.3.2 Special Process Considerations \nExcessive  signal  noise \nmay be encountered when \nThere may be situations  where it  is desirable to size \nmeasuring some slurry flows, particularly with pulsed- \nthe flowmeter at other than the \npipe  size. \nWhen \nnmse emanates from different sources at varying fre- \nquencies and  intensities. \nThe manufacturer  should \nbe \nconsulted  for \nrecommendations when a noisy output  sig- \n6.3.2.1 Accuracy.

Excessive  liner  wear \nmay be  a  consideration for increasing  the  meter  size \nio \nlower the liquid velocity. However,  excessive  liner  wear \nmay be  caused  more \nby an asymmetrical flow profile \n(see Section 6.2.2), improper  liner  material  selection  (see \nSection  6.S.2), or horizontal  installation of the  Primary \n(see Section 6.4.1 .S(a)). \nIn particular,  the  leading edge (i.e., upstream edge) of \nthe  liner may be subject to wear from abrasive  slurries. \nIf this is the case, it may be beneficial to match, if pos- \nsible,  the  inside diameter of the  Primary with the inside \ndiameter of the pipe to reduce  wear of the  leading edge. \nMetal protection  rings,  which can also act  as  grounding \nrings,  can also be  installed to reduce  this  effect. \n6.3.2.4  Fast-Settling Slurries. Velocities must \nbe  high  enough to keep  slurry  solids in suspension when \nthe Primary is mounted  horizontally.  Settling may occur \nif the  Primary is sized  larger than the  pipeline.  Also, \nif \nsolids  settle \nduring no-flow conditions, there must be \nsufficient velocity to purge  the  Primary \nof sediment at \nstart-up (see Section  6.4.1 .S(b)). \n6.4 Primary Device - \nLocation, Installation, \nand  Maintenance \n6.4.1 Primary Device Location and  Orientation \nThere are no inherent  restrictions on horizontal or ver- \ntical mounting of the  device.  However, the performance \nof magnetic  flowmeters may be influenced by the loca- \ntion and orientation of the  primary  device in the piping \nsystem.  The following  points  should be considered. \n6.4.1.1 Piping Effects. Ideally, the Primary is de- \nsigned so that the  performance of the flowmeter is the \nsame regardless of flow profile. In practice, when a flow \nvelocity profile is significantly  different  from that in the \noriginal  calibration, an electromagnetic flowmeter may \nexhibit a change in performance. The arrangement  and \nlocation of pipe fittings,  valves, \npumps,  etc., \nup and \ndownstream  (especially  upstream) of the primary device, \nare  the main factors that influence  the velocity profile. \nComplete data on the  effects of flow disturbances may \nnot always be available.  Nevertheless,  manufacturers \nusually recommend  specific  upstream \nand downstream \nlengths of straight pipe of the same nominal  diameter as \nthe Primary for proper  performance. \nSwirling flow, such  as that produced by two out-of- \nplane elbows located  upstream of the Primary, may in- \ntroduce  measurement errors. When  swirling flow  is sus- \npected or known, it is advisable, if practical, to use a \nswirl  reducing \nflow conditioner. Otherwise, it may be \nnecessary to relocate  the  Primary \nwhere  swirl is not a \nfactor. \n6.4.1.2 Full Pipe Requirements. The primary \ndevice  should be mounted in such a position that it is \ncompletely filled with the liquid  being  metered.  Other- \nwise,  this  Standard  does not apply, and the  measurement \nmay not be within the  manufacturer’s  stated accuracy. It \nmay, for  example, be difficult to  assure a full pipe in a \nvertical-down flow situation. \n6.4.1.3 Electrode Position - Horizontal In- \nstallations. Since  gas bubbles in a horizontal pipe tend \nto rise and may collect at the top of the  pipe, the primary \ndevice  should  be  mounted so that no sensing or ground- \ning electrodes are located at or near  the  top of the  pipe. \n6.4.1.4  In-Situ Zero Checking. If it is desired \nto check the flowmeter zero in-situ, a method must be \nprovided to stop the flow through the primary device, \nleaving it filled with stationary  liquid. \n6.4.1.5 Entrained Solids (Slurries). There are \ntwo  major  location  and  installation  considerations  for the \nmeasurement of liquids containing entrained  solids  (i.e., \nslurries). The manufacturer  should be consulted for all \nslurry  applications. \n(a) Abrasive Slurries. Abrasive  slurries  can cause un- \neven or excessive  liner \nwear. On the  premise \nthat a \nproper choice of liner is made (see Section  6.5.2), an \nimportant  factor in reducing  liner  wear is to have suffi- \ncient  straight length of upstream  piping to ensure that a \nsymmetrical velocity profile exists within the Primary \n(see  Section 6.4.1.1).  This tends to minimize  localized \nerosion of the liner. \nIn addition, since slurry  solids  tend to move along  the \nbottom of a horizontal pipe, excessive liner wear may \noccur in the  bottom of a horizontally  mounted Primary, \nparticularly with  highly  abrasive  slurries. \nVertical \nmounting of the primary device can prevent this situation \n(see  Section  6.2.3). \n(b) Solids Settling-Our. Under flowing conditions, \npipeline  velocities  should  be \nhigh enough to avoid set- \ntling of solids  (see  Section \n6.3.2.3).  Smooth transitions \nbetween the pipe and  the  Primary  can  reduce  settling. \nWhen  the flow stops, however, solids may settle out in \nthe Primary. Vertical mounting of the flowmeter can \navoid this  problem (see Section  6.2.3). \n6.4.1.6 Location with Regard to Electrical \nInterference. Under  most field situations,  electrical in- \nterference is not a problem.  However, \nif feasible,  the \nPrimary  should be installed in an area  where  minimal \n5 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Uncontrolled w\n\nASME  MFC-16M-1995 \nelectrical  interference,  which may result  from  equipment \noperating at high  voltage \nand/or high  current, \nis \nexpected. \nWhen  this is not possible  with  remotely  mounted Sec- \nondaries, the Primary and  Secondary should  be  located \nso that the  signal cable is run in conduit, which  can be \nseparated  from  wiring that is at  high voltage and/or car- \nries  high current. \nSome installations such as  electrolytic  processes, \nwhere  high currents may  be  flowing  through  the  piping \nand  the  liquid (and, consequently,  through  the  Primary) \nhave inherently high electrical  interferences. The man- \nufacturer  should  be  contacted for specific  grounding  and \npossibly  isolation  procedure(s) in these  situations. \n6.4.2 Installation of Primary Device \n6.4.2.1 Installation Design. When  designing the \npiping system, access  for installing  and  removing  the \nprimary device, as well as access  to the electrical  con- \nnections,  should  be  provided. Care should be taken  dur- \ning pipework construction to minimize  the  strain on the \nprimary device either  during or after  installation. \n6.4.2.2  Handling of the Primary Device. Care \nshould be taken  when  handling \nthe primary  device. \nSlings around the  primary device, or lifting  lugs,  should \nbe used on large  primary devices. Lifting by any means \nthat could damage the  liner  should be avoided. \n6.4.2.3  Pipework  Alignment  and \nConnect- \nors. Allowance  should  be \nmade for the length- of the \nPrimary,  the gaskets, and  the alignment of the  Primary \nwith the connecting pipe. \n6.4.2.4 Transition Piping. When the connecting \npipe is of a  different  size than the  Primary, it is advisable \nto use concentric reducers  upstream  and  downstream \nof \nthe Primary to affect a gradual transition  from one di- \nameter to another. In most applications,  this  should \nre- \nduce pressure loss and flow disturbance effects.  Unless \nthese  reducers \nhave a relatively shallow  taper  (typical \nmanufacturers’ recommendations vary from 8 to 15 de- \ngrees  maximum  included angle), they should be installed \nat locations  that  permit  the  manufacturers’  normal \nup- \nstream  and  downstream  straight \npipe run recommenda- \ntions to be followed.  Consult  the  manufacturer  for other \ntypes of transition  piping. \n6.4.3 Electrical Installation \n6.4.3.1  General \nRequirements. The metered \nliquid,  the  primary  device \nbody, and  the  secondary \nshould  be at the same potential,  preferably earth poten- \nMEASUREMENT  OF  FLUID  FLOW  IN CLOSED CONDUITS \nBY MEANS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC  FLOWMETERS \ntial. The manufacturer’s  instructions  should be carefully \nfollowed for interconnections  between  the  primary \nand \nsecondary  device. \nThe electrical  connection between  the liquid and  the \nprimary  device  body \nmay be made by contact  with  the \nconnecting  pipework, or by conductive grounding  (earth- \ning)  rings or electrodes.  When  lined \nor nonconductive \npipework is used, the manufacturer’s recommendations \nshould  be  adhered to, since  proper  grounding  (earthing) \nis very important. \n6.4.3.2 Power Factor (AC Systems  Only). Be- \ncause the  Primary has  coils  to  provide  the magnetic field, \nit may have a low power factor. To improve  the  power \nfactor, capacitors may be connected in parallel  with  the \nsupply by arrangement  with the manufacturer. \n6.4.3.3 Cathodic Protection. When  an  electro- \nmagnetic  flowmeter  primary device is installed in a ca- \nthodic  protected  pipeline,  precautions \nmay be  necessary \nto ensure that the  DC  component of the cathodic  current \ndoes not affect the accuracy  and  stability \nof the flow- \nmeter  system. In such a case, relevant  electric codes and \nmanufacturer’s recommendations should  be  consulted. \n6.4.4 Coatings and Deposits \nIf insulating or conducting materials are  deposited \nfrom  the  process  liquid \nonto the electrodes or the walls \nof the  meter tube, the performance of the  meter may be \naffected. In such  situations,  provision  should  be \nmade \nfor cleaning the electrodes, by either electrical, chemical, \nultrasonic, or mechanical  methods. This can  be accom- \nplished with the  flowmeter connected  to the  pipework, \nor removed  from it. Manufacturers  should  be  consulted \nfor the  various options available. \n6.5 Primary Device - \nMaterials of \nConstruction \n6.5.1 General Guidelines \nMaterials  used for  construction of process  wetted  parts \nmust be compatible with the  process. \nSafety  and  environmental  programs of end users  may \nrequire complete traceability of all process wetted and \ncontainment  materials \nused in the  manufacture \nof the \nprimary. \n6.5.2 Liner Materials \nWhen selecting a liner, the  process  liquid \nand any \ncleaning agents that will be  flowing  through  the  pipeline \n6 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Some  examples and  general appli- \ncation guidelines for liner  materials are  summarized in \nAppendix C.  These materials  have  generally  good  wear \nresistance. The manufacturer  should  be  contacted for the \nspecifications  and recommendations regarding  their  liner \nmaterials. \n6.5.3 Electrode Materials \nWhen  selecting an electrode,  the  process  liquid \nand \nany  cleaning \nagents that will be flowing through the \npipeline  must  be considered.  Examples of electrode ma- \nterials  include \nStainless Steel,  Hastelloy \nC, Platinum, \nPlatinum/Iridium, Tantalum,  Titanium,  and  Zirconium. \nManufacturers  should  be  contacted  for  specifications and \nrecommendations  regarding  their  electrode  materials. \n6.6 Secondary Device - \nInstallation \n6.6.1 Location of Secondary Device \nSecondary  devices  should be installed in an accessible \nposition with due regard  being  given to the manufactur- \ner’s  specifications. \n6.6.2 Electrical Installation \nThe  cables \ncarrying  the  electrode  signals  and  coil \ndrive and/or reference  signals  should  be \nof a type  ap- \nproved by the  manufacturer. \nCare should  be  taken to  ensure that signal cables  are \nnot routed in the same  conduits or wireways as high \nvoltage and/or high  current  carrying  cables.  Signal \nca- \nbles and  coil  drive and/or reference cables can  generally \nbe run in the same  conduit or wireway, but the  manu- \nfacturers’  instructions  should  be  followed for the  specific \ntype of flowmeter  system  being  installed. \nIf the equipment must  be  mounted \nin an area of po- \ntentially  high  electrical  interference,  the  signal,  coil, a n d  \nor reference  wiring  between the Primary  and a remotely \nmounted  Secondary  should  be  run \nin a conduit which is \nphysically  separated from high voltage and/or high cur- \nrent wiring  and equipment. \n6.7 Safety \n6.7.1 Electrical Safety \nThe primary and secondary  portions of the metering \nsystem  must  be designed, manufactured, and certified to \nmeet or exceed the  electrical  classification \nfor the  area \nin  which  installed. \nASME MFC-16M-1995 \nCabling Supplied by manufacturers to  connect \npri- \nmaries  and  secondaries  must  meet \nor  exceed area  elec- \ntrical  classifications  and  user \nsafety  codes.  The  cable \nused to connect the  meter  power  source  and  to connect \nthe  meter  output  signal to  the user’s  system  should also \nmeet area  electrical  classifications. \n6.7.2 Mechanical Safety \nThe Primary,  which is an integral  portion of the piping \nsystem, must  be designed, manufactured,  and certified to \nmeet or exceed  industry standards for piping codes (i.e., \nASME B 16 Series,  etc.)  and classifications. If this is not \nfeasible in a  given application,  the user  and  manufacturer \nmust  agree on what ratings are to apply. User  require- \nments for specific location piping  codes, material  trace- \nability, primary  cleanability,  x-rays,  etc.,  need \nto be ne- \ngotiated on an individual  basis  between  manufacturer \nand user. \nWhen using reducers and  expanders in the piping  sys- \ntem, the system  and drains  should be  designed so that \ntrapping of process fluids is avoided  and complete sys- \ntem  cleaning  needs  are \naddressed. \n7 EQUIPMENT MARKINGS \n7.1 Introduction \nThe Primary  and  Secondary  should  be  marked  either \ndirectly or on a name plate attached  thereto as indicated \nbelow. \n7.2 Primary Device \n7.2.1 Mandatory Information \n(a) Instrument  type and serial number \n(6) Liner  Material \n(c) Electrode  Material \n(d) Maximum  rated process temperature \n(e) Maximum  rated \nprocess pressure  (at  maximum \nv) Voltage, frequency, and power  requirements, if in- \n( g )  Enclosure  protection  rating \n(\\I) Flow direction  indication \nrated process temperature) \ndependently  powered \n7.2.2 Optional  Information \n(a) Nominal diameter \n(b) Meter  factor \n7 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

If this is not feasible, \nthe  user  must \nrely on a laboratory liquid calibration of \nthe  magnetic flowmeter. This calibration may be in the \nuser’s own  in-house  facility, that of the manufacturer, or \nan independent or  government testing  laboratory. \n8.2 Calibration Conditions \nThe Primary  should  be calibrated under  specified ref- \nerence  conditions.  The  ambient temperature  range,  liquid \ntemperature  range,  liquid  conductivity  range,  supply \nvoltage, and the  pipeline diameter should  be  given  as the \nreference conditions. \nThe user may want to request a system  calibration in \nwhich  the  Primary \nand  Secondary are  calibrated \nas a \nunit. This may result in improved  accuracy. \n8.3 Calibration Facilities \nThe flowmeter  calibration  facilities  should \nbe either \ngravimetric or volumetric  based,  and  shall  be  traceable \nto  NIST or some  other recognized  national or interna- \ntional standard.

Assume that a uniform  magnetic field (B) is ap- \nplied at right angles to the top and  bottom of the  conduit, \nand that the velocity profile of the conducting  liquid \nflowing full in the conduit is flat (i.e., a constant  axial \nvelocity (v)) over the entire cross-section. \nIn this  situation  the  Lorentz  force  acting on any given \ncharged  particle in the flowing liquid is the same and is \ngiven by Eq. (I), as shown by the  following: \nF, = q . B . v  \n(2) \nwhere \nF, = force on particle  moving  with liquid [newton], \nv = axial  liquid velocity [meter/second]. \nThis force is at right angles  to the  sides of the  conduit. \nThe work (W) done by the  Lorentz  force, \nif it were to \nmove one of these charges from  one side of the conduit \nto the other, is the  force (F,) times  the  distance \n(s), as \nshown by the following: \nW,, = FG = q * s * B * v  \n(3) \nwhere \nW, = work done by Lorentz. force (joule) \ns = width of conduit  (meter) \nHence, the electromotive  force \n(emf, (i.e., the work \nper unit charge) that this  device is capable of generating \nis as  follows: \nemfv = s * B \nv \n(4) \nwhere \nemf, = electromotive  force (volt) \nHence, for a fixed s and a known B, a measurement \nof the emjgenerated by the Lorentz  force (emfv) yields \na  measurement of the fluid velocity. \nIn typical  industrial  flowmeters  the conduit  is circular \nin  cross-section, the magnetic field is not uniform,  and \nthe liquid velocity profile is non-uniform  and a function \nof flow rate. Nevertheless, it can be  shown  theoretically \n(see Shercliff, J.A., Appendix D) and  demonstrated ex- \nperimentally that in this  general  situation  the \nemf gen- \nerated by the Lorentz force is given by the  following: \netnfv = C * D * Bo V \n(5) \nwhere \nemf, = electromotive force (volt) \nD = flowtube inner  diameter (meter) \n9 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Since its  magnitude can be comparable \nto emfv, a measurement  technique \nthat distinguishes \nemf, from emf, must be utilized. \nThe solution to this  problem,  which  takes \nadvantage \nof the  fact that the  electrochemical \nemf changes very \nslowly  with  time, is to vary the  magnetic field in a fixed \nperiodic  manner  (i.e., \nat a fixed frequency). The  elec- \ntronics in the  secondary device  are designed to  measure \nspecifically  this  time  varying component of the emf gen- \nerated in the  primary. To obtain  a  good \nflow measure- \nment, the  period of this  variation must be shorter  than \nthe  time it takes for emf, to drift to a detectable amount. \n10 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Uncontrolled w\n\nVarying the magnetic field to eliminate the effect of \nemfc introduces  yet another  source of emf, the induced \nemf (emf,), a  phenomenon commonly referred to as the \ntransformer  effect. This emf is equal in magnitude to the \nrate of change of the  magnetic \nflux through  the  area \ndefined by the  electrical connections leading  from the \nsecondary to the electrodes in  the  primary  device. \nThe influence of varying the magnetic field on the \nflow measurement  can  be  reduced \nto acceptable  levels \nby  appropriate measurement technqiues. In  the  case of \nAC meters emf, is 90 degrees out-of-phase (i.e., in quad- \nrature) with emfv and  hence its influence can be  reduced \nby phase  sensitive  detection techniques, using the phase \nof the  magnetic field, or a  related  electrical  quantity, \nas \nthe  reference. In the case of pulsed-DC  meters, the mea- \nsurement of e l ~ f ,  \nis made during  the  time  when the  mag- \nnetic field is,  ideally, not changing, and  hence emfi ap- \nproaches  zero. \n11 \nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

              "reasoning": "I need to extract electrical engineering requirements and specifications from the provided document, which is an ASME standard on electromagnetic flowmeters. While the document primarily discusses flow measurement, it does contain some electrical-related content. I’ll focus on sections that detail electrical aspects like signal outputs, installation, and safety classifications. Since the user asked for a JSON array, I should return an empty array if there's no electrical content, but there are a few items that qualify for inclusion.\n\nI need to focus on gathering electrical constraints from the document. This includes things like voltage, frequency, power requirements, enclosure protection ratings, and cable approvals. I’ll also look into electrical safety requirements, calibration traceability, and grounding methods. It’s important to document power factor for AC systems and specific cable routing practices. I must ensure to quote verbatim and capture all relevant statements from sections 6.4.3, 6.6, 7, and 8 for accurate records.\n\nI'm looking into Section 6.4.3.1, which emphasizes that the metered liquid, the primary device body, and the secondary device should share the same electrical potential, ideally at earth potential. It highlights the need to follow manufacturer instructions for interconnections. Grounding can be achieved through pipework or conductive rings, especially when using lined or nonconductive pipework. Additionally, Section 6.4.3.2 mentions power factor improvement through capacitors. I should keep all this in mind for the JSON extraction!\n\nIn Section 6.4.3.3, I need to note precautions regarding cathodic protection to prevent DC currents from impacting flowmeter accuracy. This connects to electrical installation aspects and requires consulting relevant codes and manufacturer recommendations, which is important but doesn't set specific numeric constraints. \n\nMoving on to Section 6.6.2, it highlights the need for approved signal cables and proper routing away from high voltage lines. Additionally, Section 6.7.1 emphasizes that both primary and secondary devices must meet electrical classification standards, including cables used for connections.

While the document primarily discusses flow measurement, it does contain some electrical-related content. I’ll focus on sections that detail electrical aspects like signal outputs, installation, and safety classifications. Since the user asked for a JSON array, I should return an empty array if there's no electrical content, but there are a few items that qualify for inclusion.\n\nI need to focus on gathering electrical constraints from the document. This includes things like voltage, frequency, power requirements, enclosure protection ratings, and cable approvals. I’ll also look into electrical safety requirements, calibration traceability, and grounding methods. It’s important to document power factor for AC systems and specific cable routing practices. I must ensure to quote verbatim and capture all relevant statements from sections 6.4.3, 6.6, 7, and 8 for accurate records.\n\nI'm looking into Section 6.4.3.1, which emphasizes that the metered liquid, the primary device body, and the secondary device should share the same electrical potential, ideally at earth potential. It highlights the need to follow manufacturer instructions for interconnections. Grounding can be achieved through pipework or conductive rings, especially when using lined or nonconductive pipework. Additionally, Section 6.4.3.2 mentions power factor improvement through capacitors. I should keep all this in mind for the JSON extraction!\n\nIn Section 6.4.3.3, I need to note precautions regarding cathodic protection to prevent DC currents from impacting flowmeter accuracy. This connects to electrical installation aspects and requires consulting relevant codes and manufacturer recommendations, which is important but doesn't set specific numeric constraints. \n\nMoving on to Section 6.6.2, it highlights the need for approved signal cables and proper routing away from high voltage lines. Additionally, Section 6.7.1 emphasizes that both primary and secondary devices must meet electrical classification standards, including cables used for connections.
