It specifically does not apply to insertion\nor medical type electromagnetic flowmeters. It also does\nnot cover applications of industrial flowmeters involving\nnonconductive liquids or highly conductive liquids (i.e.,\nliquid metals).\nThis document contains a discussion of the theory and\nmeasurement technique of an electromagnetic flowmeter,\na physical description of the various types available, ap\u0002plication considerations, specifications as to what equip\u0002ment markings should reside on the meter, and liquid\ncalibration procedures.\n2 REFERENCES\nUnless otherwise indicated, the latest issue of the fol\u0002lowing American National Standards shall be used.\nASME B16 Series, Standards for Valves, Fittings,\nFlanges, and Gaskets\nASME MFC-IM, Glossary of Terms Used in the\nMeasurement of Fluid Flow in Pipes\nASME MFC-2M, Measurement Uncertainty for Fluid\nFlow in Closed Conduits\nASME MFC-9M, Measurement of Liquid Flow in\nClosed Conduits by Weighing Method\nASME MFC-IOM, Method for Establishing Installa\u0002tion Effects on Flowmeters\nAWWA C207, Steel Pipe Flanges for Waterworks Ser\u0002vice (Sizes 4 in. through 144 in.)\nSee Appendix D for other applicable standards.\n3 TERMINOLOGY\nDefinitions stated in ASME MFC-IM and MFC-2M\napply to this Standard.

The largest value obtained over the\nfull flow range is the meter’s stated repeatability.\n4 THEORY AND MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE\nThe basic principle on which all electromagnetic flow\u0002meters are based is the Lorentz Force law (see A1 of\nAppendix A). Consider the electromagnetic flowmeter\nconfigurations shown in Fig. 1. A magnetic field (B) has\nbeen applied at right angles to the pipe axis in which a\nconducting fluid is flowing. In addition, two electrodes\nhave been placed on opposite sides of the pipe wall\nalong a line that is at right angles to both the pipe axis\nand the magnetic field. The Lorentz Force law applied\nto these configuratlons leads to an electromotive force\n(emfv) (i.e., a flow signal) being generated between the\nelectrodes, which is given by the following:\nenfv = C . D . B,, * V\nwhere\nemf, = electromotive force (volt)\nD = flowtube inner diameter (meter)\nBo = magnetic field at the center of the flowtube\nV = flow velocity (average liquid velocity over the\n(tesla)\ncross-section) (meter/second)\nC = a dimensionless parameter that depends on the\nspecific design of the flowmeter and to a lim\u0002ited extent on the velocity profile. The veloc\u0002ity profile sensitivity of C also depends on the\nspecific design of the flowmeter (see Sections\n6.2.2 and 6.4.1.1).\nIn addition to the above flow-related electromotive\nforce (emf,), an electrochemical electromotive force\nemfc is also produced in the flowtube. The magnitude\nof e&, which changes very slowly in time, can be com\u0002parable to emf,. To reduce the influence of emf, on the\nflow measurement to acceptable levels, all electromag\u0002netic flowmeters operate with time varying magnetic\nfields. The measurement electronics is designed to look\nspecifically at this time varying component of the signal\ncoming from the flowtube (for additional details, see A2\nof Appendix A).\nPresent commercial meters fall into two groups ac\u0002cording to the manner in which the magnetic field is\nvaried. It is termed an AC meter if the field is varied\nsinusoidally (see Fig. 2(a)), a pulsed-DC meter if it is\nvaried in a stepwise fashion (see Figs. 2(b) and (c)).\nThe fact that time varying flow related signals are be\u0002ing generated means that, in principle, either wetted or\nnon-wetted (i.e., capacitive) sensing electrodes can be\nused in the flowmeter to detect he flow signal (see\nFig. 1).\n5 FLOWMETER DESCRIPTION\n5.1 Overview\nThe electromagnetic flowmeter consists of two\nelements:\n2\nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

It also includes magnetic field coils and two or\nmore sensing electrodes that may be wetted or non\u0002wetted (see Fig. 1). It may also include grounding elec\u0002trodes, or grounding rings as required by the application\nor design of the meter.\n5.3 Secondary Device\nThe Secondary consists of the electronic transmitter\nand its housing which may be mounted either integral\nwith the Primary, or remotely. If the Secondary is\nmounted remotely from the Primary, it may be necessary\nto have a separate electrical connection housing, termin\u0002als, and pre-amplifier mounted on the Primary, if re\u0002quired by the design of the electronics. The Secondary\nprovides the output from the meter, and in some cases\n3\nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Uncontrolled w\nASME MFC-16M-1995\nMEASUREMENT OF FLUID FLOW IN CLOSED CONDUITS\nBY MEANS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FLOWMETERS\nprovides power to the coils. The coils may be either AC 6.2.2 Velocity Profile Effect\nor pulsed-DC powered, depending on the design of the\nmeter. Distortions in velocity profiles may be caused by pipe\nfittings (bends, valves, reducers, etc.) placed upstream or\ndownstream from the flowmeter. The resulting flow pat\u0002terns may influence the performance of the meter (see 5.4 Outputs from the Secondary Section 6.4.1.1).\nThe output from the Secondary may be'an analog sig\u0002nal (i.e., 4-20 ma DC), a pulse output (frequency), or a\ndigital signal. The pulse output may be scaled or un\u0002scaled. Other optional outputs include solid-state or me\u0002chanical contact closures. Some designs also offer the\noption of local visual indication of rate of flow and/or\ntotalized flow.\n6 APPLICATION CONSIDERATIONS\n6.1 Process Liquid\n6.1.1 Liquid Electrical Conductivity\n6.2.3 Slippage\nThe solids in a slurry may move at a different velocity\nthan the liquid (Le., slippage may occur). In vertical in\u0002stallations settling solids in a slurry may appear as re\u0002verse flow if the normal flow direction is up, and as\nforward flow if the normal flow is down. Depending on\nthe application, slippage may affect the relationship be\u0002tween the meter output and the quantity of interest. Con\u0002sult the manufacturer for all slurry applications.\n6.3 Primary Device - Sizing Considerations\nIf the electrical conductivity of the liquid is uniform,\nthe meter output is generally independent of the liquid 6.3.1 General Considerations\nconductivity when the latter is above a specified mini\u0002mum value. The minimum liquid conductivity should be\nobtained from the manufacturer.\nIf, however, the conductivity is not uniform through\u0002out the meter, errors may occur. Non-homogeneous\nstreams, such as blends, should be sufficiently mixed so\nas to have uniform electrical conductivity in the mea\u0002surement region. A heterogeneous liquid, such as a\nslurry, composed of small particles uniformly distributed\nin a medium can be considered an electrically homo\u0002geneous liquid.\n6.1.2 Noisy Flow Signal\nMagnetic flowmeters have high inherent rangeability.\nTherefore, it is normally feasible to select a primary of\nthe same nominal size as the connecting pipe. When this\nis the case, the pressure drop through the Primary can\nbe considered the same as that of an;equivalent length\nof pipe. This sizing ability usually affords a process\nfriendly installation, particularly with regard to the mea\u0002surement of abrasive and fast-settling slurry flows.\nIt should be noted, however, that for small meters (1/2\nin. and under) the meter bore diameter is normally based\non fluid flow rate considerations rather than pipe size.\n6.3.2 Special Process Considerations\nExcessive signal noise may be encountered when There may be situations where it is desirable to size\nmeasuring some slurry flows, particularly with pulsed- the flowmeter at other than the pipe size.

If this low velocity condition\nexists, it may be desirable to size the meter at less than\nDC systems.

Uncontrolled w\nMEASUREMENT OF FLUID FLOW IN CLOSED CONDUITS\nBY MEANS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FLOWMETERS ASME MFC-16M-1995\n6.3.2.3 Abrasive Slurries. Excessive liner wear\nmay be a consideration for increasing the meter size io\nlower the liquid velocity. However, excessive liner wear\nmay be caused more by an asymmetrical flow profile\n(see Section 6.2.2), improper liner material selection (see\nSection 6.S.2), or horizontal installation of the Primary\n(see Section 6.4.1 .S(a)).\nIn particular, the leading edge (i.e., upstream edge) of\nthe liner may be subject to wear from abrasive slurries.\nIf this is the case, it may be beneficial to match, if pos\u0002sible, the inside diameter of the Primary with the inside\ndiameter of the pipe to reduce wear of the leading edge.\nMetal protection rings, which can also act as grounding\nrings, can also be installed to reduce this effect.\n6.3.2.4 Fast-Settling Slurries. Velocities must\nbe high enough to keep slurry solids in suspension when\nthe Primary is mounted horizontally. Settling may occur\nif the Primary is sized larger than the pipeline. Also, if\nsolids settle during no-flow conditions, there must be\nsufficient velocity to purge the Primary of sediment at\nstart-up (see Section 6.4.1 .S(b)).\n6.4 Primary Device - Location, Installation,\nand Maintenance\n6.4.1 Primary Device Location and Orientation\nThere are no inherent restrictions on horizontal or ver\u0002tical mounting of the device. However, the performance\nof magnetic flowmeters may be influenced by the loca\u0002tion and orientation of the primary device in the piping\nsystem. The following points should be considered.\n6.4.1.1 Piping Effects. Ideally, the Primary is de\u0002signed so that the performance of the flowmeter is the\nsame regardless of flow profile. In practice, when a flow\nvelocity profile is significantly different from that in the\noriginal calibration, an electromagnetic flowmeter may\nexhibit a change in performance. The arrangement and\nlocation of pipe fittings, valves, pumps, etc., up and\ndownstream (especially upstream) of the primary device,\nare the main factors that influence the velocity profile.\nComplete data on the effects of flow disturbances may\nnot always be available. Nevertheless, manufacturers\nusually recommend specific upstream and downstream\nlengths of straight pipe of the same nominal diameter as\nthe Primary for proper performance.\nSwirling flow, such as that produced by two out-of\u0002plane elbows located upstream of the Primary, may in\u0002troduce measurement errors. When swirling flow is sus\u0002pected or known, it is advisable, if practical, to use a\nswirl reducing flow conditioner. Otherwise, it may be\nnecessary to relocate the Primary where swirl is not a\nfactor.\n6.4.1.2 Full Pipe Requirements. The primary\ndevice should be mounted in such a position that it is\ncompletely filled with the liquid being metered. Other\u0002wise, this Standard does not apply, and the measurement\nmay not be within the manufacturer’s stated accuracy. It\nmay, for example, be difficult to assure a full pipe in a\nvertical-down flow situation.\n6.4.1.3 Electrode Position - Horizontal In\u0002stallations. Since gas bubbles in a horizontal pipe tend\nto rise and may collect at the top of the pipe, the primary\ndevice should be mounted so that no sensing or ground\u0002ing electrodes are located at or near the top of the pipe.\n6.4.1.4 In-Situ Zero Checking. If it is desired\nto check the flowmeter zero in-situ, a method must be\nprovided to stop the flow through the primary device,\nleaving it filled with stationary liquid.\n6.4.1.5 Entrained Solids (Slurries). There are\ntwo major location and installation considerations for the\nmeasurement of liquids containing entrained solids (i.e.,\nslurries). The manufacturer should be consulted for all\nslurry applications.\n(a) Abrasive Slurries. Abrasive slurries can cause un\u0002even or excessive liner wear. On the premise that a\nproper choice of liner is made (see Section 6.5.2), an\nimportant factor in reducing liner wear is to have suffi\u0002cient straight length of upstream piping to ensure that a\nsymmetrical velocity profile exists within the Primary\n(see Section 6.4.1.1). This tends to minimize localized\nerosion of the liner.\nIn addition, since slurry solids tend to move along the\nbottom of a horizontal pipe, excessive liner wear may\noccur in the bottom of a horizontally mounted Primary,\nparticularly with highly abrasive slurries. Vertical\nmounting of the primary device can prevent this situation\n(see Section 6.2.3).\n(b) Solids Settling-Our. Under flowing conditions,\npipeline velocities should be high enough to avoid set\u0002tling of solids (see Section 6.3.2.3). Smooth transitions\nbetween the pipe and the Primary can reduce settling.\nWhen the flow stops, however, solids may settle out in\nthe Primary. Vertical mounting of the flowmeter can\navoid this problem (see Section 6.2.3).\n6.4.1.6 Location with Regard to Electrical\nInterference. Under most field situations, electrical in\u0002terference is not a problem. However, if feasible, the\nPrimary should be installed in an area where minimal\n5\nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User. No further reproduction or distribution is permitted. Uncontrolled w\nASME MFC-16M-1995\nelectrical interference, which may result from equipment\noperating at high voltage and/or high current, is\nexpected.\nWhen this is not possible with remotely mounted Sec\u0002ondaries, the Primary and Secondary should be located\nso that the signal cable is run in conduit, which can be\nseparated from wiring that is at high voltage and/or car\u0002ries high current.\nSome installations such as electrolytic processes,\nwhere high currents may be flowing through the piping\nand the liquid (and, consequently, through the Primary)\nhave inherently high electrical interferences. The man\u0002ufacturer should be contacted for specific grounding and\npossibly isolation procedure(s) in these situations.\n6.4.2 Installation of Primary Device\n6.4.2.1 Installation Design. When designing the\npiping system, access for installing and removing the\nprimary device, as well as access to the electrical con\u0002nections, should be provided. Care should be taken dur\u0002ing pipework construction to minimize the strain on the\nprimary device either during or after installation.\n6.4.2.2 Handling of the Primary Device. Care\nshould be taken when handling the primary device.\nSlings around the primary device, or lifting lugs, should\nbe used on large primary devices. Lifting by any means\nthat could damage the liner should be avoided.\n6.4.2.3 Pipework Alignment and Connect\u0002ors. Allowance should be made for the length- of the\nPrimary, the gaskets, and the alignment of the Primary\nwith the connecting pipe.\n6.4.2.4 Transition Piping. When the connecting\npipe is of a different size than the Primary, it is advisable\nto use concentric reducers upstream and downstream of\nthe Primary to affect a gradual transition from one di\u0002ameter to another. In most applications, this should re\u0002duce pressure loss and flow disturbance effects. Unless\nthese reducers have a relatively shallow taper (typical\nmanufacturers’ recommendations vary from 8 to 15 de\u0002grees maximum included angle), they should be installed\nat locations that permit the manufacturers’ normal up\u0002stream and downstream straight pipe run recommenda\u0002tions to be followed. Consult the manufacturer for other\ntypes of transition piping.\n6.4.3 Electrical Installation\n6.4.3.1 General Requirements. The metered\nliquid, the primary device body, and the secondary\nshould be at the same potential, preferably earth poten\u0002MEASUREMENT OF FLUID FLOW IN CLOSED CONDUITS\nBY MEANS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FLOWMETERS\ntial. The manufacturer’s instructions should be carefully\nfollowed for interconnections between the primary and\nsecondary device.\nThe electrical connection between the liquid and the\nprimary device body may be made by contact with the\nconnecting pipework, or by conductive grounding (earth\u0002ing) rings or electrodes. When lined or nonconductive\npipework is used, the manufacturer’s recommendations\nshould be adhered to, since proper grounding (earthing)\nis very important.\n6.4.3.2 Power Factor (AC Systems Only). Be\u0002cause the Primary has coils to provide the magnetic field,\nit may have a low power factor. To improve the power\nfactor, capacitors may be connected in parallel with the\nsupply by arrangement with the manufacturer.\n6.4.3.3 Cathodic Protection. When an electro\u0002magnetic flowmeter primary device is installed in a ca\u0002thodic protected pipeline, precautions may be necessary\nto ensure that the DC component of the cathodic current\ndoes not affect the accuracy and stability of the flow\u0002meter system. In such a case, relevant electric codes and\nmanufacturer’s recommendations should be consulted.\n6.4.4 Coatings and Deposits\nIf insulating or conducting materials are deposited\nfrom the process liquid onto the electrodes or the walls\nof the meter tube, the performance of the meter may be\naffected. In such situations, provision should be made\nfor cleaning the electrodes, by either electrical, chemical,\nultrasonic, or mechanical methods. This can be accom\u0002plished with the flowmeter connected to the pipework,\nor removed from it. Manufacturers should be consulted\nfor the various options available.\n6.5 Primary Device - Materials of\nConstruction\n6.5.1 General Guidelines\nMaterials used for construction of process wetted parts\nmust be compatible with the process.\nSafety and environmental programs of end users may\nrequire complete traceability of all process wetted and\ncontainment materials used in the manufacture of the\nprimary.\n6.5.2 Liner Materials\nWhen selecting a liner, the process liquid and any\ncleaning agents that will be flowing through the pipeline\n6\nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

Some examples and general appli\u0002cation guidelines for liner materials are summarized in\nAppendix C. These materials have generally good wear\nresistance. The manufacturer should be contacted for the\nspecifications and recommendations regarding their liner\nmaterials.\n6.5.3 Electrode Materials\nWhen selecting an electrode, the process liquid and\nany cleaning agents that will be flowing through the\npipeline must be considered. Examples of electrode ma\u0002terials include Stainless Steel, Hastelloy C, Platinum,\nPlatinum/Iridium, Tantalum, Titanium, and Zirconium.\nManufacturers should be contacted for specifications and\nrecommendations regarding their electrode materials.\n6.6 Secondary Device - Installation\n6.6.1 Location of Secondary Device\nSecondary devices should be installed in an accessible\nposition with due regard being given to the manufactur\u0002er’s specifications.\n6.6.2 Electrical Installation\nThe cables carrying the electrode signals and coil\ndrive and/or reference signals should be of a type ap\u0002proved by the manufacturer.\nCare should be taken to ensure that signal cables are\nnot routed in the same conduits or wireways as high\nvoltage and/or high current carrying cables. Signal ca\u0002bles and coil drive and/or reference cables can generally\nbe run in the same conduit or wireway, but the manu\u0002facturers’ instructions should be followed for the specific\ntype of flowmeter system being installed.\nIf the equipment must be mounted in an area of po\u0002tentially high electrical interference, the signal, coil, and\nor reference wiring between the Primary and a remotely\nmounted Secondary should be run in a conduit which is\nphysically separated from high voltage and/or high cur\u0002rent wiring and equipment.\n6.7 Safety\n6.7.1 Electrical Safety\nThe primary and secondary portions of the metering\nsystem must be designed, manufactured, and certified to\nmeet or exceed the electrical classification for the area\nin which installed.\nASME MFC-16M-1995\nCabling Supplied by manufacturers to connect pri\u0002maries and secondaries must meet or exceed area elec\u0002trical classifications and user safety codes. The cable\nused to connect the meter power source and to connect\nthe meter output signal to the user’s system should also\nmeet area electrical classifications.\n6.7.2 Mechanical Safety\nThe Primary, which is an integral portion of the piping\nsystem, must be designed, manufactured, and certified to\nmeet or exceed industry standards for piping codes (i.e.,\nASME B 16 Series, etc.) and classifications. If this is not\nfeasible in a given application, the user and manufacturer\nmust agree on what ratings are to apply. User require\u0002ments for specific location piping codes, material trace\u0002ability, primary cleanability, x-rays, etc., need to be ne\u0002gotiated on an individual basis between manufacturer\nand user.\nWhen using reducers and expanders in the piping sys\u0002tem, the system and drains should be designed so that\ntrapping of process fluids is avoided and complete sys\u0002tem cleaning needs are addressed.\n7 EQUIPMENT MARKINGS\n7.1 Introduction\nThe Primary and Secondary should be marked either\ndirectly or on a name plate attached thereto as indicated\nbelow.\n7.2 Primary Device\n7.2.1 Mandatory Information\n(a) Instrument type and serial number\n(6) Liner Material\n(c) Electrode Material\n(d) Maximum rated process temperature\n(e) Maximum rated process pressure (at maximum\nv) Voltage, frequency, and power requirements, if in-\n(g) Enclosure protection rating\n(\\I) Flow direction indication\nrated process temperature)\ndependently powered\n7.2.2 Optional Information\n(a) Nominal diameter\n(b) Meter factor\n7\nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

If this is not feasible,\nthe user must rely on a laboratory liquid calibration of\nthe magnetic flowmeter. This calibration may be in the\nuser’s own in-house facility, that of the manufacturer, or\nan independent or government testing laboratory.\n8.2 Calibration Conditions\nThe Primary should be calibrated under specified ref\u0002erence conditions. The ambientemperature range, liquid\ntemperature range, liquid conductivity range, supply\nvoltage, and the pipeline diameter should be given as the\nreference conditions.\nThe user may want to request a system calibration in\nwhich the Primary and Secondary are calibrated as a\nunit. This may result in improved accuracy.\n8.3 Calibration Facilities\nThe flowmeter calibration facilities should be either\ngravimetric or volumetric based, and shall be traceable\nto NIST or some other recognized national or interna\u0002tional standard.

Uncontrolled w\nAPPENDIX A\nADDED DETAILS REGARDING THEORY AND MEASUREMENT\nTECHNIQUE\n(This Appendix is not part of ASME MFC-16M-1995 and is included for\ninformation only.)\nA1 THEORY\nThe underlying principle on which all electromagnetic\nflowmeters are based is the Lorentz Force law, which\nstates that a particle with charge q moving with velocity\nu at right angles to a magnetic field (B) experiences a\nforce given by the following:\nF, = q*B*u (1)\nwhere\nF,, = force on particle (newton)\nq = charge on particle (coulomb)\nu = velocity of particle (meter/second)\nB = magnetic field (tesla)\nThe direction of this force is at right angles to both\nthe direction of motion and the direction of the magnetic\nfield as shown in Fig. AI.\nSince an electrically conducting liquid has within it a\ncollection of mobile charged particles (i.e., ions or elec\u0002trons) the Lorentz Force law can be applied to them.\nConsider a rectangular uniform cross-section conduit,\nas shown in Fig. A2, made of electrically insulating ma\u0002terial. Assume that a uniform magnetic field (B) is ap\u0002plied at right angles to the top and bottom of the conduit,\nand that the velocity profile of the conducting liquid\nflowing full in the conduit is flat (i.e., a constant axial\nvelocity (v)) over the entire cross-section.\nIn this situation the Lorentz force acting on any given\ncharged particle in the flowing liquid is the same and is\ngiven by Eq. (I), as shown by the following:\nF, = q.B.v (2)\nwhere\nF, = force on particle moving with liquid [newton],\nv = axial liquid velocity [meter/second].\nThis force is at right angles to the sides of the conduit.\nThe work (W) done by the Lorentz force, if it were to\nmove one of these charges from one side of the conduit\nto the other, is the force (F,) times the distance (s), as\nshown by the following:\nW,, = FG = q*s*B*v (3)\nwhere\nW, = work done by Lorentz. force (joule)\ns = width of conduit (meter)\nHence, the electromotive force (emf, (i.e., the work\nper unit charge) that this device is capable of generating\nis as follows:\nemfv = s * B v (4)\nwhere\nemf, = electromotive force (volt)\nHence, for a fixed s and a known B, a measurement\nof the emjgenerated by the Lorentz force (emfv) yields\na measurement of the fluid velocity.\nIn typical industrial flowmeters the conduit is circular\nin cross-section, the magnetic field is not uniform, and\nthe liquid velocity profile is non-uniform and a function\nof flow rate. Nevertheless, it can be shown theoretically\n(see Shercliff, J.A., Appendix D) and demonstrated ex\u0002perimentally that in this general situation the emf gen\u0002erated by the Lorentz force is given by the following:\netnfv = C * D * Bo V (5)\nwhere\nemf, = electromotive force (volt)\nD = flowtube inner diameter (meter)\n9\nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.

A2 LORENTZ FORCE LAW APPLIED TO A CONDUCTING LIQUID FLOWING IN A\nRECTANGULAR CROSS-SECTION CONDUIT WITH INSULATING WALLS\nBo = magnetic field at the center of the flowtube\n(tesla)\nV = flow velocity (average axial liquid velocity\nover the cross-section) (meterkecond)\nC = a dimensionless parameter that depends on the\nspecific design of the flowtube and to a limited\nextent on the velocity profile\nA2 MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE\nIn addition to the emf generated by the Lorentz force\n(emfv) (i.e., the flow signal), an electrochemical emf\n(emfc) is produced in the primary device. This emf is\ngenerated at the interface between the process liquid and\nthe surface of electrodes used to detect emfv, in the case\nof wetted electrodes, or between the process fluid and\nthe insulating walls of the primary, in the case of non\u0002wetted electrodes. This emj similar to that gener\u0002ated in a battery, appears on the sensing electrodes to\u0002gether with emfv. Since its magnitude can be comparable\nto emfv, a measurement echnique that distinguishes\nemf, from emf, must be utilized.\nThe solution to this problem, which takes advantage\nof the fact that the electrochemical emf changes very\nslowly with time, is to vary the magnetic field in a fixed\nperiodic manner (i.e., at a fixed frequency). The elec\u0002tronics in the secondary device are designed to measure\nspecifically this time varying component of the emf gen\u0002erated in the primary. To obtain a good flow measure\u0002ment, the period of this variation must be shorter than\nthe time it takes for emf, to drift to a detectable amount.\n10\nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User. No further reproduction or distribution is permitted. Uncontrolled w\nVarying the magnetic field to eliminate the effect of\nemfc introduces yet another source of emf, the induced\nemf (emf,), a phenomenon commonly referred to as the\ntransformer effect. This emf is equal in magnitude to the\nrate of change of the magnetic flux through the area\ndefined by the electrical connections leading from the\nsecondary to the electrodes in the primary device.\nThe influence of varying the magnetic field on the\nflow measurement can be reduced to acceptable levels\nby appropriate measurement technqiues. In the case of\nAC meters emf, is 90 degrees out-of-phase (i.e., in quad\u0002rature) with emfv and hence its influence can be reduced\nby phase sensitive detection techniques, using the phase\nof the magnetic field, or a related electrical quantity, as\nthe reference. In the case of pulsed-DC meters, the mea\u0002surement of el~f, is made during the time when the mag\u0002netic field is, ideally, not changing, and hence emfi ap\u0002proaches zero.\n11\nCopyrighted material licensed to Stanford University by Thomson Scientific (www.techstreet.com), downloaded on Oct-05-2010 by Stanford University User.
