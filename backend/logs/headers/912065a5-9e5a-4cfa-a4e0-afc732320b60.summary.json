Various types of phase-shifting\ntransformers and how to select the optimal design to achieve required control of power flow are\ncovered. An understanding of the terminology, types, construction, and testing specifical to phase\u0002shifting transformers is provided.\nKeywords: advance phase angle, dual-core design, main transformer, power transfer, phase\u0002shifting transformer, retard phase angle, series transformer, single-core design, special tests\nIEEE Standards documents are developed within the IEEE Societies and the Standards Coordinating Committees of the\nIEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) Standards Board. The IEEE develops its standards through a consensus develop\u0002ment process, approved by the American National Standards Institute, which brings together volunteers representing varied\nviewpoints and interests to achieve the final product.

All rights reserved.\n4. Application and theory of PSTs\n4.1 Introduction\nThe development of large, high-voltage power grids has enabled power consumers to enjoy the benefits of\nmore reliable and efficient service and has allowed generation sources to be, in some cases, located long\ndistances from large load centers. While large interconnected grids strengthen a power system’s reliability,\ncomplications can arise with the control of steady-state power flow along certain segments of the system.\nThese complications can be attributed to several factors, including the impedance of parallel paths in the\npower grid, variation in power generation output, variation in loads, and load center phase angles.\n4.2 Basic principle of application—advanced and retard phase angle\nPSTs are used to control the power flow in electrical power systems. When power flows between two\nsystems, there is a voltage drop and a phase angle shift between the source and the load that depends upon\nthe magnitude and power factor of the load current. If the systems are connected together in two or more\nparallel paths so that a loop exists, any difference in the impedances will cause unbalanced line loading.\nFigure 1 shows an example with the load-side power factor assumed to be 1 and the system resistances being\nnegligible with respect to their reactances. An arbitrary power flow distribution can be obtained by inserting\na PST into one of the branches. Dependent upon whether the PST is installed in the branch with the higher or\nlower impedance, an advanced or a retard phase angle is needed. Advanced means that the L terminal\nvoltage (VL) leads the S terminal voltage (VS); retard means that the L terminal voltage (VL) lags the S\nterminal voltage (VS).\n(1)\nSystem 1, Z1, I1\nSystem 2, Z2, I2\nI\nVS VL\nVL*\nDV\nZi~ jXi\nI1*Z1\nV S V L\nI1*Z1\nV S V L\nI2*Z2\nD V V S V L V L*\nDV I2*Z2\nV S V V L L *\nI1*Z1 < I2*Z211*Z1 > I2*Z2\nAdvanced: V L * leadsV S Retard: V L* lagsV S\nFigure 1—Load-side power factor of 1\nI 2 × ∆ Z2 – V I 11 × ∆ 1 V I 2 × Z211 × Z1 = ⇒ = –\nIEEE\nSPECIFICATION, AND TESTING OF PHASE-SHIFTING TRANSFORMERS Std C57.135-2001\nCopyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved. 5\nA numerical example should illustrate this. If it is required that both systems are loaded with 50% of the\ntotal transferred power 2S, and the impedances are assumed to be z1 = 0.02 and z2 = .30, related to S, the\nnecessary additional voltage becomes ∆V = .30 – 0.02 = .28. Hence, a load phase angle (advanced) of about\n15.6° is necessary. The total angle between source and load becomes 1.1°. In the case of z1 = 0.30 and\nz2 = 0.02, the same load phase angle (retard) would be needed but the total phase angle between source and\nload would become 16.7°. If no measures were taken, the load distribution between system 1 and 2 would be\n0.9375 to 0.0625 instead of 0.5 to 0.5.\nA second important application is the use of a PST to control the power flow between two large independent\ngrids. An advanced phase-shifting angle is necessary to achieve a flow of active power from system 1 to\nsystem 2 (Figure 2).\n4.3 The PST under load\nSo far an ideal PST, i.e., a transformer with an impedance zT = 0, has been dealt with. To demonstrate load\nconditions, an equivalent circuit is used, as shown in Figure 3, with an ideal PST with zT = 0 and an\nadditional transformer with a turns ratio of 1:1 and an impedance zT = RT + jXT.\nWhere\nVL\n* is load voltage (no-load),\nVL is load voltage (loaded),\nVS(a) is source voltage (advanced),\nVS(r) is source voltage (retard),\nIL is load current,\ncosϕL is load power factor,\nzT is transformer impedance,\nβ is transformer load angle,\nα is phase-shift angle,\n+ advanced\n– retard.\nFigure 2—Advanced phase-shifting angle\nIEEE\nStd C57.135-2001 IEEE GUIDE FOR THE APPLICATION,\n6 Copyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved.\nThe phasor diagram of the PST can be drawn. Starting with the load voltage VL and calculating the ohmic\nand reactive voltage drop in the 1:1 transformer, the load voltage VL\n* at its primary side can be obtained. The\nload phase angle β can be calculated by using Equation (2).\n(2)\nThe phase-shifting unit adds ±α and so, finally, the load phase angles of the transformer α*\n(a) and α*(r)\nrespectively are obtained.\nα*(a) = α – β is phase-shift angle (loaded) advance (3)\nα*\n(r) = –(α + β) is phase-shift angle (loaded) retard (4)\nTo obtain an advanced phase angle α*\n(a) under load, the no-load phase angle α has to be chosen properly\nunder consideration of the phase angle β of the PST. On the other hand, the retard phase angle α∗\n(r) is\nincreased under load. This has an impact on transformer and tap-changer as dealt with in 4.8.4.\n4.4 Power transfer\nA PST has two separate effects on power flow. First, the no-load phase angle creates an additional voltage\nthat drives additional current through the line. Second, by the PST, an additional impedance is added to the\ncircuit. These two effects may work against each other. Therefore, a minimum phase angle is usually\nrequired to compensate for the additional voltage drop across the PST’s impedance in the advanced position.\nTo ease the following considerations, the impedance of the PST has been assumed to be constant over the\nwhole regulating range, a tolerable approximation for two-core designs (the impedance of single-core\ndesigns is commonly zero at zero degree phase shift).\nWith the denotations used in Figure 3 and\nP0 is power transferred when α = 0 (preload)\nQ0 is reactive power transferred when α = 0 (preload)\nFigure 3—Demonstration of load conditions\nβ arc\nIL X cosϕL IL × R × sinϕL × × –\nVL IL X sinϕL I + × × + L × R × cosϕL\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- arctan zT × cosϕL\n100 z + T × sinϕL\n= tan ≅ ----------------------------------------\nIEEE\nSPECIFICATION, AND TESTING OF PHASE-SHIFTING TRANSFORMERS Std C57.135-2001\nCopyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved. 7\nthe power components at the source side become\n(5)\n(6)\nFigure 4 explains the effect of the introduction of the phase-shift angle α. In the equation, the first two terms\nreflect the effect of the phase angle on the original power flow as easily as can be derived from Figure 4. The\nlast term represents the additional power flow generated by the additional voltage ∆V across the impedance\njX of the PST. Taking into consideration that the real component of ∆V(–∆V cos(α/2) drives a current with a\npositive imaginary component, and the imaginary component of ∆V(∆V*sin(α/2)) a current with a positive\nreal component and that ∆V= 2*Vs\n*sin(α/2), the last terms in Equation (3) and Equation (4) respectively can\nbe confirmed without difficulties.\nFigure 5 shows the variation of the additional power flow (assumption: P0 = Q0 = 0, ZT ≈ jXT, Vs\n2/XT = 1)\nwith the PST angle α.\nFigure 6 shows as an example the variation of the power flow at the source side with the phase angle α,\ndepending on different preload conditions. The maximum additional transferred power has been assumed to\nbe 1.\nIt can be seen how the power flow is influenced when the no-load phase angle of the PST is changed from\nzero to maximum leading phase shift. The highest increase of active power for the same phase shift appears\nwhen a negative reactive power flow exists, i.e., with high capacitive load. An inductive load (positive\nreactive power) decreases the effect of the PST.\nThe reactive power flow is also influenced by the preload condition. The active power has the major impact\non the influence of the PST angle.\nP( ) α P0\n∗cosα Q0∗sinα\nVS\n2\nXT\n= – + --------*sinα\nQ( ) α P0\n∗sinα Q0∗cosα\nVS\n2\nXT\n+ 1 -------- αo = + ( ) – cos\nFigure 4—Effect of phase-shift angle α\nIEEE\nStd C57.135-2001 IEEE GUIDE FOR THE APPLICATION,\n8 Copyright © 2002 IEEE.

Figure 7a\nshows an elementary arrangement; the phasor diagrams are drawn for no-load condition. A PST is used with\nthe exciting winding delta-connected. The regulating winding of phase V2–V3 is connected to phase V1 and\nFigure 5—Variation of additional power flow with the PST angle α\nFigure 6—Variation of power flow with the phase-shift angle α\ndepending on different preload conditions\nIEEE\nSPECIFICATION, AND TESTING OF PHASE-SHIFTING TRANSFORMERS Std C57.135-2001\nCopyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved. 9\nso on. The scheme has been plotted for subtractive polarity of the windings and the tap position has been\nchosen so that the transformer produces an advanced phase angle. Under no-load condition the regulation is\nsymmetrical, i.e., the absolute values of source and load voltage are the same.\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\nWith consideration of these equations, the phasor diagram can be drawn and absolute values can be\ndetermined.\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n(15)\nFigure 7a—Phasor diagrams for no-load condition\nVS1 V10\n∆V1\n2 = + ----------\nVL1 V10\n∆V1\n2 = – ----------\nV ∆ V20 V30 = –\nVS1 = = VL1 V1\nV10 V1\n∗ α\n2 = cos---\n∆V1 V1\n∗2∗ α\n2 = sin---\nV ∆ V10∗ 3 V1\n∗ 3∗ α\n2 = = cos---\nI S1 IL11 = = 1\nI∆ IL1∗∆V1\nV ∆\n----------\n∗ α\n2 cos--- IL1∗ 2\n3\n------∗ α\n2 = = sin---\nIEEE\nStd C57.135-2001 IEEE GUIDE FOR THE APPLICATION,\n10 Copyright © 2002 IEEE.

The user’s electric power system\nrequirements and the manufacturer’s preference generally determine the design. The major factors\ndetermining the type of PSTs are given below:\nPerformance factors\n— The power rating and phase-shift angle requirements\n— The voltages\n— The connected system’s short-circuit capability\nDesign factors\n— Type of construction (core form or shell form)\n— Layer or disc winding design\n— Shipping limitations\n— Load tap changer (LTC) performance specification\nThese factors decide whether a single-core or a two-core type has to be chosen. These two types are\ndescribed in more detail in the following clauses.\n4.5.2 Single-core design\nWith the design outlined in Figure 7a, symmetrical conditions are obtained. The LTC can also be equipped\nwith a reversing change-over selector. This solution permits changing from an advanced phase angle to a\nretard phase angle. With the single-core design, it is generally accepted practice to supply two sets of three\nsingle pole tap changers: one set connected to the S terminals, and the second set connected to the L\nterminals. As a simplified solution, it is also possible to use only one-half of the tapped winding. But in that\ncase the load voltage increases with respect to the source voltage with increasing phase angle (Figure 7b).\nPs 3∗V1\n∗I L1\n= =\nPT 3∗∆V\n=1 ∗I=L1 Ps\n∗2∗ α\n2 = = sin---\nFigure 7b—PST with half tap winding\nIEEE\nSPECIFICATION, AND TESTING OF PHASE-SHIFTING TRANSFORMERS Std C57.135-2001\nCopyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved. 11\nIn the case of a small rated switching capacity (step voltage × through current), a solution with one two\u0002phase LTC per phase is possible, using an LTC assembly according to Figure 8.\nAs a further example, Figure 9 shows the connection diagram and the phasor diagram of a delta-hexagonal\nPST. These transformers have LTCs with linear regulation, i.e., without a change-over selector.3\nThe single-core design is less complex and has fewer kVA parts than two-core designs, but has some\ndisadvantages as follows:\n— The LTC and the tapped winding are in the line end of the windings and are directly exposed to the\nsystem short-circuit currents and overvoltages.\n— Voltage per tap and current are determined by the phase angle requirement and rating of the PST and\ncannot be adjusted to obtain optimum switching conditions. If one of these parameters exceeds its\nlimit, the solution would not be possible although the required switching capability may still be\ngiven.\n3\nThere are numerous other possibilities, e.g., designs with de-energized operation.\nFigure 8—PST with small switching capacity\nFigure 9—Connection diagram and the phasor diagram of\na delta-hexagonal PST\nIEEE\nStd C57.135-2001 IEEE GUIDE FOR THE APPLICATION,\n12 Copyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved.\n4.5.3 Two-core design\nThe most commonly used circuit for two-core designs is shown in Figure 10. This configuration consists of a\nseries unit and a main unit. For smaller ratings and lower voltages, two-core PSTs may be built into one\nsingle tank, while large ratings and high voltage PSTs require a two-tank design.\nThe advantage of a two-core design is the flexibility in selecting the step voltage and the current of the\nregulating winding. They can be optimized in line with the voltage and current ratings of the LTC. Since\nLTCs have limited current ratings and step voltages per phase as well as limited switching capacity, they are\nthe main limiting feature for the maximum possible rating of PSTs. More than one LTC per phase may have\nto be utilized for very large ratings.\nFurthermore, three-pole LTCs can be used. If the rated switching capacity is too high, three single-pole\nLTCs have to be used. The LTC insulation level to ground is independent of the system voltage and can\ngenerally be kept low. The potential connection of the regulating winding has to be checked (see 4.6.1) but\noften it is not critical and the values are comparable with those of a regulating winding at the neutral end of\na common network transformer.\n4.6 Special on load tap changer (OLTC) features\n4.6.1 Potential connection of the regulating winding\nDuring the operation of the reversing change-over selector, the regulating winding is temporarily\ndisconnected from the main winding. Its potential at this moment is determined by the voltages of the\nadjacent windings as well as by the coupling capacitances to these windings and to grounded parts. The\nresulting differential voltage exerts stress across the switching distance of the opening change-over selector\ncontacts. In the case of PSTs having regulation at the line end, high recovery voltages can occur due to the\nwinding arrangement. The change-over operation takes place in the mid-position of the LTC, i.e., when the\ntap selectors are in position “K” (see Figure 8).\nFigure 11 shows a typical winding arrangement and the resulting phasor diagram. It can be seen that the\nrecovery voltages are higher than the system line-to-ground voltages of the source and load side. The limit of\nthe recovery voltages is in the range of 15–35 kV. This condition has to be taken into account during design\nof a PST. One possibility to decrease the recovery voltage is to install shields between the windings. Each\nshield must be connected to the “K” point of the corresponding phase.\nFigure 10—Commonly used circuit for two-core designs\nIEEE\nSPECIFICATION, AND TESTING OF PHASE-SHIFTING TRANSFORMERS Std C57.135-2001\nCopyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved. 13\nBoth recovery voltages occurring during reversing change-over selector operation and switched current\nresulting from capacitances have limitations. The limit of the magnitude of this current is in the range of a\nfew hundred milliamperes.\nIn special cases when a third winding with a low voltage level is specified, it may be possible to use this\nwinding instead of the shields. Shielding has, in addition, the advantage that it protects the regulating\nwinding from capacitively transferred transients. If shielding is not possible, one of the following solutions\nhas to be used to solve the problem:\na) The first way is to connect the tap winding to a fixed potential during the reversing change-over\noperation by a fixed ohmic resistor or capacitor that is usually connected to the middle of the regu\u0002lating winding and to the current take-off terminal of the LTC. This solution is not applicable in\nevery case (especially with arrangements according to Figure 11, when no shields are used). The\nconnection of resistors or capacitors increases the amount of switched current due to the small resis\u0002tance compared to that of the capacitances.\nb) The second possibility is to use an advance-retard switch (ARS) as shown in Figure 12. This switch\nallows the reversing change-over operation to be carried out in two steps without interruption. The\nregulating winding remains connected to a fixed potential during the whole operation. The limiting\nparameter for the ARS is the process of commutation, which has to be controlled by the ARS. It is\ndetermined by the commutation of the through current from a small inductive loop to a larger one.\n4.6.2 LTC with coarse change-over selector\nBy using the change-over selector for inserting a coarse regulating winding, the achievable phase angle in\none direction can be enlarged. If a change from advanced to retard position is required, an additional\nswitching device, which has to be designed like an ARS, is necessary so that the switching can be performed\nwithout interruption of the load current. The ARS has to control the process of commutation which, in this\ncase, is not only determined by the loop formed by the connecting leads but also by the impedance of the\nwinding itself. If the reversing operation can be carried out with a de-energized transformer, an off-circuit\ntap changer is sufficient. Figure 13 shows different arrangements with coarse change-over selectors (a, b)\nand, in addition, the use of two LTCs (c). Also the arrangement of an ARS for the exciting winding of the\nseries transformer is shown in (b).\nFigure 11—Impact of shields on recovery voltage\nIEEE\nStd C57.135-2001 IEEE GUIDE FOR THE APPLICATION,\n14 Copyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved.\n4.6.3 Number of OLTCs required\nSee Table 1.\n4.7 Arrangement of more than one PST\n4.7.1 Series connection of PSTs\nIf two or more (n) identical PSTs are connected in series, the phase-shift angles and impedances from each\nPST add together to produce a total equivalent phase shift and impedance. The MVA rating of the bank of\nseries connected PSTs is equivalent to the MVA rating of each PST. For example, two 100 MVA PSTs, each\nwith a 5° phase shift and 10% impedance connected in series will be equivalent to one 100 MVA PST with a\n10° phase shift and 20% impedance. In case of an outage of one unit, the full current can be maintained with\n(n–1)/n maximum phase-angle shift, but possible short-circuit problems have to be considered because of\nthe diminished impedance.\nFigure 12—Use of ARS\nFigure 13—Different arrangements with coarse change-over selectors\nIEEE\nSPECIFICATION, AND TESTING OF PHASE-SHIFTING TRANSFORMERS Std C57.135-2001\nCopyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved. 15\n4.7.2 Parallel connection of PSTs\nIf two or more (n) identical PSTs are connected in parallel, the impedance from each PST combine in\nparallel to provide a reduced total impedance. The MVA rating of the bank of parallel-connected PSTs is\nequivalent to the sum of the MVA ratings of all parallel-connected PSTs. For example, two 100 MVA PSTs,\neach with a 5° phase shift and 10% impedance connected in parallel will be equivalent to one 200 MVA PST\nwith a 5° phase shift and 5% impedance.\n4.8 Design criteria\n4.8.1 Phase angle\nThe rated phase angle is defined under no-load conditions. However, it should be noted that the unit is\nunlikely to operate at this phase angle under load in the advanced position due to the effect of the voltage\ndrop in the unit. In the retard position the no-load phase angle should not be exceeded (unless the unit has\nbeen designed for that), as overexcitation will occur in parts of the PST (see also 4.8.4). In the retard position\nthe power that can be transferred is usually lower than the rated power in the advanced position.\nTable 1—Minimum number of LTCs required\nType Figure Regulation Number of LTCs Number of ARSs\nSingle- core\n7a\n7b\nLTC with reversing\nchange-over\nselectora\n3 two-phase units or\n6 single-phase unitsb\nor\n3 single-phase unitsc\nNone\n12\nLTC plus ARS\nacting as a reversing\nchange-over\nselector\n6 single-phase units 3–6 unitsd\n9\nLTC without change\u0002over\nselector (linear\nregulation)\n6 single-phase units None\nTwo-core 10\nLTC with reversing\nchange-over\nselector\n1 three-phase unit\n(wye-connected) or\n3 single-phase unitsb\nNone\n13(a) LTC with one coarse\nwinding\n1 three-phase unit\n(wye-connected) or\n3 single-phase unitsb\n1–3 unitsd\n13(b) LTC with several\ncoarse windings\n1 three-phase unit\n(wye-connected) or\n3 single-phase unitsb\n1–3 unitsd\n13(c)\nTwo LTCs in series\nwith coarse change\u0002over selector\n1 three-phase unit\n(wye-connected) or\n3 single-phase unitsb\nand\n3 single-phase units\n1–3 unitsd\na\nThe reversing change-over selector is not shown on Figure 7a and Figure 7b.\nb\nDepending on rated switching capacity and through current.

All rights reserved.\n4.8.2 Dielectric design of the two-core type\nThe transmission of transient voltages in the two-core design is rather complex. When applying impulse\ntests to either the S or the L terminals of the series transformer, the connected exciting winding of the main\ntransformer will also be exposed to a high voltage. There may be high-voltage oscillations of the connecting\nleads, depending on the capacitive voltage control of the series winding. High voltages may be transferred to\nother windings coupled to the series winding or to the excitation winding. Therefore, rather complex\ncomputer models may be required to compute the transient voltages for this configuration.\n4.8.3 Special considerations for a two-tank design\nWhen the two-core design is used with two tanks, special precautions must be taken to design connections\nbetween the two tanks. As illustrated in Figure 10, the connection operates at the system voltage level so that\nthe leads must be insulated for the overvoltages that may occur under both transients and power frequency\nconditions. A short-circuit between the connections of the two units has to be considered as an internal fault,\nwhich would cause severe damage or even destroy the PST. A short-circuit proof design for this special case\nwould result, if possible at all, in a significant increase in cost. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to use\nmetal enclosures to protect the connections against lightning strikes and other possible sources of a short\ncircuit.\n4.8.4 Overload conditions (loading above nameplate rating)\nOverloading of a PST in the sense of operating it with a current beyond the name-plate rating increases the\ninternal phase angle β [see Equation (2)] and consequently also the load phase-shift angle α∗\n(r) in the retard\nposition [see Equation (4)]. This may result in a load phase angle that exceeds the maximum rated no-load\nphase angle. The voltage across the regulating winding and consequently also the voltage per step of a\nsingle-core type, as well as the voltage across the series winding of a two-core type will, in this case, exceed\nthe rated voltage. Furthermore, in a two-core design, the main transformer also will experience a certain\ndegree of overexcitation with the same consequences for the regulating winding. The degree depends on the\nratio of the impedances of series and main transformer.\nIt must—beside the effect that parts of the core(s) may be overfluxed—therefore also be checked whether\nthe parameters’ voltage per step, current, and switching capability are still within the limits of the LTC\ndesign.\n5. Service conditions\nPSTs conforming to this guide will be suitable for operation at rated voltage and rated kVA as follows:\n5.1 Usual service conditions\nThese conditions shall be as stated in IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000, 4.1.1 through 4.1.7, and 4.1.9; 4.1.8 shall\nnot apply. In 4.1.6.1 (a), the word secondary shall mean the L terminals of the PST.\na) The purchaser of the PST shall specify the switching arrangements that will be used to place the PST\nin and out of service. This shall include breaker or switch operations resulting from faults external\nand internal to the PST.\nb) The PST shall be suitable for energization by voltage applied to either the S or L terminals.\nc) The PST shall be capable of transferring rated kVA with the electrical source of power connected to\nthe S or L terminals. Limited power transfer in the retard position has to be considered.\nd) Seismic requirements shall be as specified in IEEE Std 693-1997. The seismic zone shall be\nprovided by the purchaser. The foundation design shall be provided to the PST manufacturer by the\nIEEE\nSPECIFICATION, AND TESTING OF PHASE-SHIFTING TRANSFORMERS Std C57.135-2001\nCopyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved. 17\npurchaser. The manufacturer shall provide for differential motion between the two tanks, if used, and\nin the case of remotely mounted radiators provide for their differential motion.\ne) The manufacturer of the PST shall make provisions for differential alignments that will occur when\ntwo tanks are connected. The foundation tolerance shall be defined by agreement between purchaser\nand manufacturer.\nf) Unless specified otherwise, the PST shall be manufactured for operation in the bypassed state with\nthe source and load bushing connected through bus work. This shall require special consideration in\ndesign for lightning impulse and switching surges. This condition will require additional testing with\nthe terminals connected, as in operation, to demonstrate that the insulation level meets the specified\nBIL.\n5.2 Loading at other than rated conditions\nThis subclause shall be the same as IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000, 4.2, with the exception that additional\nlimits must be observed for retard operation under overload. These limits must be defined by the\nmanufacturer and agreed upon by the purchaser prior to completion of the PST design.\n5.3 Unusual service conditions\nThe unusual conditions shall be the same as those listed in IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000, 4.3.1 through 4.3.3.\nAdditional unusual service conditions that may apply to PSTs are as follows:\n5.3.1 Operation with two or more PSTs in parallel or in series\nThe purchaser shall ensure the manufacturer has all nameplate data, test data, and applicable system\ninformation necessary to design the PSTs for proper load sharing. The purchaser must specify in detail to the\nmanufacturer the LTC’s controls that will be provided by the purchaser. If the manufacturer provides the\nLTC’s controls, the purchaser shall provide the control scheme used with any existing PSTs to the\nmanufacturer to ensure a compatible system.\n5.3.2 Operation of PSTs in series with series capacitor banks\nIf the PST is, or may be, operated in series with a series capacitor bank, this operating condition shall be\npointed out to the manufacturer by the purchaser. The operating conditions shall be specified and the\nprotection scheme used by the purchaser to prevent series resonance shall be provided to the PST\nmanufacturer for review and for considerations in design.\n5.3.3 Unbalanced current flow through the PST\nThe purchaser must provide details of operating conditions that will subject the PSTs to unbalanced phase\ncurrents and voltages that may exceed allowable standard limits. The manufacturer will provide for these\nconditions during the design of the PSTs. The following are examples of operating conditions that could\nproduce such problems:\na) Unbalances resulting from operation of parallel transmission lines in close proximity to the PST\nconnected lines, where line transpositions are unequal resulting in unbalanced voltage at the PSTs\nand unequal current flow through the series windings.\nb) Single-pole operation of the circuit breakers following line faults where single-pole reclosing is\nutilized\nIEEE\nStd C57.135-2001 IEEE GUIDE FOR THE APPLICATION,\n18 Copyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved.\n5.3.4 Transient recovery voltages\nTransient voltage may exist circuit breakers are operated. These conditions may be between the PST and the\ncircuit breaker.\n5.3.5 Surge protection\nAny condition where the PST may operate without surge protection applied at all S and L terminals.\n5.4 Protection\nThe protection scheme recommended for PSTs is similar to that for power transformers with one notable\nexception: differential relaying. In general, transformer differential relays are designed to allow for a\ndifference between the primary and secondary currents of the transformer of at least 10% because of the\nvoltage taps. This is done by means of restraint windings (or logic) that desensitize the relay during heavy\nthrough fault currents. For a PST with a phase angle difference of 25° between the source and load currents,\nthe current difference would be about 43%, so a special differential scheme is required. In 5.4.1, differential\nschemes for PSTs will be briefly discussed with emphasis on the PST requirements. Ground protection is\nalso included because of its close association with differential protection. For a more detailed discussion of\ndifferential and ground protection, see “Applied Protective Relaying”[B1], Brown, et al. [B4], Ibrahim,\nStacom [B8], [B9], Li [B13], Plumptre [B22], and Sen, Craig [B23]. Other types of protection are discussed\nin 5.4.2.\n5.4.1 Differential and ground protection\nThe complete current transformer (CT) requirements must be determined and the purchaser must agree to\nthe locations before the design can be finalized since internal buried CTs are often required. Protection\nschemes are different for the two types of PST core construction: single- and two-core arrangements.\n5.4.1.1 Single-core arrangement\nA differential scheme for the single-core arrangements shown in Figure 7a and Figure 7b should provide\nprimary differential protection that will not misoperate because of PST core saturation. A three-phase\ntransformer differential relay is required with three restraint elements per phase. It is preferable that the CTs\nhave the same ratings and ratios, although the relay can typically compensate for some mismatch.\n5.4.1.2 Two-core arrangement\nThe most common differential scheme for the two-core arrangement (see Figure 10) is shown in Figure 14\nand Figure 15. There are two sets of differential protection. Figure 14 shows the primary set and Figure 15,\nthe secondary set. The two sets provide differential protection with redundancy.\nThe primary differential relay (Figure 14, 87P) requires a set of CTs in the neutral of the primary winding of\nthe main unit. These will probably be inside the tank. It is preferable that these CTs have the same rating and\nratio as the high side CTs, although the differential relay can compensate for some mismatch. This scheme is\nnot affected by PST core saturation. A ground relay (51N1) is usually installed in the neutral of the primary\nof the main unit to provide sensitive protection for ground faults near the neutral. It will see current during\nground faults on the system. The amount of current will depend on the sequence network impedance. If the\nmain unit is of shell form construction, the zero sequence current will be relatively high. However, if it is of\ncore form construction or if the secondary circuits provide a path for zero sequence currents because of\nvoltage regulating windings on the main unit (see “Applied Protective Relaying” [B1], and Sen, Craig\n[B23]), the zero sequence impedance will be much lower and 51N1 must coordinate with line side ground\nrelays. The 51N1 relay is also subject to false operation due to inrush current when the main unit is\nIEEE\nSPECIFICATION, AND TESTING OF PHASE-SHIFTING TRANSFORMERS Std C57.135-2001\nCopyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved. 19\nenergized. To prevent this from happening, the relay must be desensitized or a relay with second harmonic\nrestraint used (see Plumptre [B22]). The associated CT may be external to the tank.\nThe secondary differential relay (Figure 15, 87S) requires a set of CTs in the neutral of the secondary of the\nmain unit. They will also most likely be inside the tank. The ratio of these CTs will be determined by the\nratio (K) of the series unit, as shown in Figure 15. The differential relay can compensate for some CT\nmismatch. The rating of the CTs should closely match the high side CTs. A three-phase transformer\ndifferential relay is required with three restraint elements per phase. The integrity of this scheme depends on\nthe value of “K” remaining constant—the series unit not saturating. Since the voltage rating of the series unit\nis considerably smaller than rated phase-to-ground voltage, it is possible that it might saturate during heavy\nthrough faults (see Ibrahim, Stacom [B8]). If series unit saturation is a problem, desensitizing the secondary\nrelay system is required. A ground relay (50N2) is usually installed in the neutral of the main unit secondary\nwinding. This relay can be set quite sensitive since there should be current in it only during a fault in the\nmain unit secondary circuit. The associated CT may be external to the tank.\n5.4.2 Other types of protection\n5.4.2.1 Sudden pressure (rapid rate of rise) relaying\nSudden pressure relays protect for arcing faults. It is common practice to have one or more sudden pressure\nrelays for each oil-filled tank and separate compartment, the number of relays depending on the oil volume.\nThe PST manufacturer should recommend the quantity, location, and type of sudden pressure relays and the\nsettings, if not specified by the purchaser. Buchholz relays also will protect for oil displacement.\n5.4.2.2 Pressure relief device\nEach oil-filled tank and separate oil-filled compartment shall be provided with a pressure relief device. It is\ncommon practice to have more than one pressure relief device on large tanks. The number of pressure relief\ndevices should be determined by the manufacturer.\nIEEE\nStd C57.135-2001 IEEE GUIDE FOR THE APPLICATION,\n20 Copyright © 2002 IEEE.

The use of a device to\naccumulate the gas and cause an alarm or trip is recommended for each compartment.\n6. Rating data\nIn general, rating data for PSTs should be in accordance with the requirements for power transformers as\ncovered in IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000 with the following exceptions or additions.\nFigure 15—Secondary differential relay\nIEEE\nStd C57.135-2001 IEEE GUIDE FOR THE APPLICATION,\n22 Copyright © 2002 IEEE.

The L terminals shall be marked L1, L2, L3,\nand (if applicable) L0. Y and Z designations shall be used for additional windings that are brought out of the\ntank.\n6.1.2 Enclosed throat connection terminal markings\nEnclosed throat winding terminal connections shall be marked in any manner that will permit convenient\nreference and cannot be confused with the markings of the external transformer terminals.\n6.2 Impedance\nImpedance shall be in accordance with IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000 with the following additions.\n6.2.1 General\nRated impedance shall be at zero phase-shift connections.\n6.2.2 Change in impedance with phase-angle regulation\nThe impedance of PSTs can vary substantially over its range of phase-angle regulation. The user must\nspecify the acceptable ranges of impedances and the manufacturer shall calculate and provide a matrix of\nimpedances as required by the user. The extent of test verification of impedance values other than rated\nimpedance should be specified and agreed upon by the purchaser and manufacturer.\n6.3 Nameplates\nNameplates shall be in accordance with IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000 with the following addition:\nThe nameplate of the PST shall show the phase shift in degrees from the S to the L terminals starting at the\nzero phase-shift tap and for each tap position in the advance and retard direction while operating at no-load.\nThe nameplate shall also show the phase shift in degrees from the S to the L terminals while operating at\nmaximum rated kVA output at unity power factor at the S terminal for all tap positions which result in\nacceptable service conditions. Intermediary phase shifts at varying loads may be specified by the purchaser\nfor inclusion on the nameplate.\nThe user may request impedance changes be indicated on the nameplate for any tap position.\n7. Construction\nIn general, construction requirements for PSTs should be in accordance with the requirements for power\ntransformers, as covered in IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000 and other applicable IEEE standards based on kV\nand kVA ratings, with the following exceptions or additions.\nIEEE\nSPECIFICATION, AND TESTING OF PHASE-SHIFTING TRANSFORMERS Std C57.135-2001\nCopyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved. 23\n7.1 Enclosed throat connections\nEnclosed throat connections in fully assembled condition must meet the pressure and vacuum requirements\nof PST tanks for all designs that subject the enclosed throat connection to the same operating pressures and\nvacuum levels as the transformer tank.\n7.2 Liquid insulation and preservation system\nLiquid insulation and preservation systems shall be in accordance with IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000 with the\nfollowing addition.\n7.2.1 Two tank designs with enclosed liquid-filled throat connection\nEnclosed liquid-filled throat connections may be either sealed from each tank or opened to the insulating\nfluid from one or both tanks. Enclosed throat connections shall be designed for installation or removal\nwithout the need to jack or move either or both of the transformer tanks and shall accommodate thermal\nexpansion and contraction of the throat assembly and both tanks.\nFor a sealed throat system that isolates the insulating fluid, the throat connections require a separate\nconservator system.\nFor a system where the throats are not directly connected to a main tank and the isolation of the insulating\nfluid in different compartments is not important, the throats may be connected to the conservator system of\nthe main tank. If this approach is used, the user should be aware that the use of oil and gas analysis to isolate\nproblems will be complicated.\nFor throat connections that place barriers between both the tanks and the throat, the throat shall be equipped\nwith the following accessories:\n— Gas accumulation relay\n— Pressure relief device/relay\n— Liquid filling and draining valves\n— Rapid rate of rise relay\n— Liquid level gauge\n8. Short-circuit characteristics\n8.1 Short circuit requirements\n8.1.1 General\nPSTs shall comply with the short circuit requirements of IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000, unless otherwise\nagreed upon by the purchaser and manufacturer.\n8.1.2 Transformer categories\nThe kVA rating to be considered for determining the category should be the equivalent to the rating\naccording to IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000.\nIEEE\nStd C57.135-2001 IEEE GUIDE FOR THE APPLICATION,\n24 Copyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved.\n8.1.3 Short-circuit current magnitude\nThe manufacturer shall determine the most onerous conditions for short circuit on every winding or active\npart in accordance with IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000. These conditions should take into account the large\nimpedance swings that can occur as the tap position is changed from the extreme positions to the mid\nposition. Since the system short-circuit levels are critical to the design of PSTs, the user shall specify the\nmaximum system short-circuit fault levels expected throughout the life of the unit.\nIf a short-circuit test is performed, it shall be done in accordance with IEEE Std C57.12.90-1993. The test\nshall be carried out on the tap position that produces the most severe stresses in each winding. This may\nrequire more than a single test depending on the type of construction.\nFor two-core PSTs this usually requires a test on the zero phase-shift position, as this position involves only\nthe series transformer, and a second test on a position to be agreed upon between customer and\nmanufacturer.\n9. Control system\n9.1 Control equipment and accessories\nControl devices to facilitate manual and automatic control of the load tap changing equipment shall be\nprovided.\nThe control system of a PST includes a sensing apparatus to provide a signal proportioned to the system real\npower flow through the transformer. For this purpose, positive (+) values of power flow relate to an exchange\ndefined as forward power flow (FPF), i.e., power from normal S terminals to normal L terminals. Similarly,\nnegative (–) values of power flow relate to an exchange defined as reverse power flow (RPF), i.e., power\nfrom normal L terminals to normal S terminals.\nThe control system also includes a control device to interpret the input of the sensing apparatus, relate the\ninput to conditions desired by the operator, and to automatically command the tap changer of the PST to\nfunction to hold the power flow thereby required.\nThe total control system is usually furnished as a complete package with the transformer; however, the\nstand-alone nature of the control system makes it appropriate to consider the control system in a unified\ncontext.\nA weather-resistant cabinet shall be provided for housing the automatic control and related devices.

Record the\ndifference in control system power flow recognition to actual system power flow in range of –1.5 pu–1.5 pu\nin steps of 0.25 pu.\n9.3.1.1.2 Test for error in power due to ambient temperature\nThis test is made at 1.0 pu forward power flow ± 0.01 pu and rated system frequency ± 0.01 Hz.

All rights reserved. 27\n9.3.2.2 Operational test\nAll features of the control device and its peripherals will be operated and checked for verification of proper\nfunctioning. The control is also calibrated at this point.\n10. Testing of PSTs\n10.1 General\nUnless otherwise specified, all tests carried out at the factory should be made in accordance with IEEE Std\nC57.12.90-1993. Additional tests, particular to PSTs, are defined in 11.2, Special tests for PSTs. Since the\nmethod of testing PSTs is dependent on the design, the testing methods will be mutually agreed upon by the\nuser and manufacturer.\n10.1.1 Test set-up for PSTs\n10.1.1.1 Resonant frequency and transient voltage tests\nThese tests are normally performed on the core and coil assembly in air. However, they can also be\nperformed inside the tank filled with oil and fitted with temporary bushings to give access to required test\npoints. For a two-core design in one or more tanks, the windings must be interconnected as for impulse\ntesting.\nThese tests are intended to verify the transient voltages and natural frequencies at various points in the\nwindings at all tap combinations and connections that can be compared and evaluated with studies.\n10.1.1.2 Temperature tests and loss distribution\nIn most cases temporary bushings must be installed for connections to windings, which are not normally\naccessible, in order to determine the various resistances for the temperature tests and to determine the losses\nand the distribution of these losses.\nThe location of these temporary bushings depends on the design and winding configuration and is subject to\nagreement between user and manufacturer. For two-tank designs, the tanks may be separate to determine the\nlosses in the various cores and windings and the temperature test. This information will be provided by the\nmanufacturer to the user during preliminary discussions.\n10.1.1.3 Dielectric test\nFor dielectric tests each tank with its corresponding core and windings should be connected electrically and\nmechanically together as for the service condition. In most cases, temporary bushings must be installed on\nlower voltage windings in order to perform the IEEE standard low frequency induced test on the higher\nsource and load side windings.\nIn very high voltage PSTs, it is sometimes necessary to install an auxiliary winding next to the core for\nshielding purposes. This auxiliary winding can then be used for performing the low-frequency induced test\nthrough the use of temporary bushings.\nIEEE\nStd C57.135-2001 IEEE GUIDE FOR THE APPLICATION,\n28 Copyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved.\n10.2 Special tests for PSTs\n10.2.1 Special dielectric test\nWhen a bypass switch is installed, there are two special dielectric tests that may be specified by the user.\n10.2.1.1 Special lighting impulse test\nThe special lightning impulse test shall be applied individually to each phase with the L and S side terminals\nconnected together. The untested L and S side terminals should be grounded separately through resistors.\nThe neutral terminal(s) shall be grounded through shunts for current monitoring. In some cases, it is\ndesirable to perform the tests with the S or L terminals floating. The test shall be performed on tap positions\nmutually agreed upon by both the user and manufacturer.\n10.2.1.2 Special switching impulse test\nA special switching impulse test shall be applied to each phase with the L and S side terminals under test\nbeing tied together. The other untested terminals are connected together, floating and connected to a voltage\ndivider. The neutral terminal(s) shall be solidly grounded through a shunt for current monitoring. This test\nonly applies to PSTs rated 345 kV and above, or as required by the user.\n10.2.2 Measurement of phasor group and no-load phase angle\nThe phase angle of a phase shifter is not normally measured directly but is calculated from the triangle\nformed by the voltage across the series winding and the voltage across the shunt winding, which are at right\nangles (see Figure 10).\nUsing a low voltage 3-phase supply applied to the S terminals as VS1, VS2, and VS3 and measuring the\ndesignated magnitude of each voltage, the phase angle on each tap may be determined.\nThe magnitudes of the test voltages measured are indicated in the following list, with the phase angle\ncalculated from the equation.\na) The series voltage measured between the S terminal S1 and the L terminal L1 = VS1–L1\nb) The supply phase voltages measured between S terminal S1 and the neutral N = V S–N\nc) The load phase voltage measured between L terminal L1 and the neutral N = VL–N\nd) The voltage between S terminals S1 and S2 = VS1–S2\ne) The voltage between the S terminal S1 and the L terminal L2 = VS1–L2\n(18)\nThe phase angle is advanced if VS1–S2 > VS1–L2 and retarded if VS1–L2 > VS1–S2.\n11. Tolerances\n11.1 General\nThe tolerances should be as in IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000, unless otherwise specified here or agreed\nbetween purchaser and manufacturer.\nα arc\nVSN\n2 VLN2 VS1 – L12 ( ) + –\n2∗VSN∗VLN ( ) = cos-------------------------------------------------------------\nIEEE\nSPECIFICATION, AND TESTING OF PHASE-SHIFTING TRANSFORMERS Std C57.135-2001\nCopyright © 2002 IEEE. All rights reserved. 29\n11.2 Tolerances for ratio of series and main units\nFor two-core PSTs the voltage ratios of the series or of the main unit is a design parameter, as the leads\ncorresponding to those windings are not usually brought out.\nFor PSTs with constant modulus shift such as described in 4.5.2, even if a tertiary winding is specified or\nnecessary, it is not practical to guarantee a constant voltage ratio as the no-load voltage is subject to change\ndepending on the phase-angle shift.\n11.3 Tolerance for phase angle and impedance\nPhase angle and impedance tolerance will be in accordance with IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000 for tw o\u0002winding transformers. In cases where the circulating current must be minimized or where units will be\nparalleled, the angle and impedance tolerances should be established by agreement between the user and the\nmanufacturer.\n11.3.1 Tolerance for phase angle\nThe tolerance for phase-angle shift at no-load on all tap positions should be within 1% of the respective rated\nphase-angle shift.\n11.3.2 Tolerance for impedance\nThe impedance should lie within an envelope specifying a minimum and a maximum over the full tapping\nrange. The user and manufacturer shall agree on the tolerance.\n12. Bid document checklist\nThe following is a checklist on what should be covered in a bid specification for a PST document that is not\nnormally included in a typical transformer bid document. This list should not be considered all-inclusive, but\nused only as a guide. It should also be noted that no technical definitions, detailed requirements, or standards\nare given in this clause, but that this type of detailed information will be found in the other referenced\nclauses.\n12.1 Nontechnical information\nThe following nontechnical information should be presented in the commercial part of the bid document.\nThe buyer should state in the bid document if they will or will not employ the supplier’s installation\nsupervisor.\n12.2 Technical information\nThe following technical information should be specified for the PST by the user in the technical specification\nclause of the tender document.\n12.2.1 Equipment options required\nThe various phase angle regulations and power ratings that are being requested by the buyer for\nconsideration should be clearly defined.
