# QA Notes — Phase 01

## Automated checks
- `pytest` (backend + unit tests) — PASS

## Additional verification
- Searched the codebase to ensure `/api/specs` and `spec_records` no longer appear outside the planning files.
- Reviewed the updated frontend to confirm all visible "Analyze Specs" controls were removed.
- Confirmed the README now describes the SOW-only workflow and endpoints.
